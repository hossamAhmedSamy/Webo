A customer is an individual or company that receives, consumes, or buys a product or service. The primary goal of a commercial enterprise is to attract customers. But that isn't just a one-time event. It involves maintaining a strong relationship with customers over time, ensuring they want to continue doing business with your organization.

Organizations manage customer relationships through customer engagement. Customer engagement represents the emotional connection between a customer and a brand. How an organization engages their customers directly impacts their relationship with them. Highly engaged customers buy more and demonstrate greater loyalty.

Many organizations use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to assist them as they engage with their customers. These applications help organizations fundamentally reimagine how they engage customers. They help organizations create personalized marketing, sales, and service experiences using data and intelligence to improve every interaction.

Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps, which are built on the Power Platform, are Microsoft’s CRM applications that help organizations manage customer relationships. Organizations can utilize these applications individually or together to create powerful end-to-end relationships with their customers. For example, an organization that's selling products and services to their customers can use Dynamics 365 Sales to assist sellers in managing their sales pipeline, engaging with customers, and building relationships.

While each application provides a specific solution, they share common elements that are the same regardless of the application you're using. This module introduces you to the different Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps and examines elements that are common across all of them.

Before we examine the different Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications, let’s examine what they're built on. As mentioned initially, Dynamics 365’s customer engagement applications are built on Microsoft Power Platform. Power Platform is Microsoft’s low-code application development platform that not only spans Dynamics 365, but also Office 365, Azure, and standalone applications. It combines the power of Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, and Power Pages into one business application platform that provides quick and easy app building and data insights.

The Power Platform is important to Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps for many different reasons. First, all Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps are what are referred to as model-driven applications. Model-driven applications are built using Power Apps. They're based on a data model store within Microsoft Dataverse, which we cover in the next unit. Components such as forms, views, charts, and dashboards are used to present data to end users.

Model-driven applications aren't the only component of the Power Platform used by Dynamics 365 applications. Overall, the Power Platform components used by Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps can include:

Power Apps: Power Apps provides a rapid low code development environment for building custom apps for business needs. It's a suite of apps development services with a scalable data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) and an ability to interact with cloud & on-premises data sources. Power Apps enables the creation of web and mobile applications that run on all devices.

Power BI: The business analytics capabilities provided by Power BI are often used to connect to Dynamics 365 applications and provide important insight into an organization. These visualizations can then be used inside Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, or Customer Service.

Power Automate: Items called business process flows are the primary component in Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. They help provide a guide for people to get work done. For example, Dynamics 365 Sales includes business process flow that helps guide sellers beginning with a Lead and ending with a closed sale.

Power Pages: Many organizations provide customers with self-support options where customers can access a portal and find answers to questions, engage with support, or even open new support tickets. Power Pages makes it easy for organizations to create externally facing sites that connect to Dataverse that customers can access.

Copilot Studio: As agents continue to work into our daily lives, Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to create custom agents that can be used to extend the capabilities of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps. For example, you could create an agent to assist customers with support questions and reduce workloads of your representatives.

One of the key elements to building business solutions on this platform is Microsoft Dataverse. Dataverse allows you to securely store and manage data used by your business applications. For example, you might store all your customer data in Dataverse. Dataverse data is stored in tables. A table is a set of rows and columns. Each column in a table stores a specific type of data such as names, locations, ages, dates, salaries, and so on.

Dataverse includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical business scenarios such as accounts, contacts, and activities. The advantage to Dataverse is that organizations can also create custom tables specific to their needs and populate them with data.

For example:

A real estate company might create tables to store the properties they sell, represent open houses, or store showings.

A financial company might add tables to represent loan applications or bank accounts.

An auto repair company might add tables to represent the parts they sell or the services they provide.

Application makers can use tools like Power Apps to build rich applications that use this data.

Dataverse provides these benefits:

Easy to manage: Both the metadata and data are stored in the cloud.

Easy to secure: Data is securely stored so users can only access what they need to. Role-based security allows you to control access to tables for different users within your organization.

Rich metadata: Data types and relationships are used directly within Power Apps.

Logic and validation: Define calculated columns, business rules, workflows, and business process flows to ensure data quality and drive business processes.

Productivity tools: Tables are available within the add-ins for Microsoft Excel to increase productivity and ensure data accessibility.

Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, or Dynamics 365 Customer Insights use Dataverse to store and secure their data. This enables you to build apps by using Power Apps and Dataverse directly with your core business data, which is already used within Dynamics 365, without the need for integration.

Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps help organizations fundamentally reimagine how they engage with customers. Organizations can create personalized marketing, sales, and service experiences using data and intelligence to improve every interaction.

There are five core Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights:

Dynamics Customer Insights comprises two individual applications: Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys and Dynamics Customer Insights - Data.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys is a marketing automation application that helps turn prospects into business relationships. Whether it's creating rich and dynamic marketing content or helping you understand your leads better, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys provides you with everything that it needs to take control of your marketing efforts. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys is powered by Microsoft Power Platform and provides customers with the ability to analyze, target, and engage with their customers.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data can help you build a deeper understanding of your customers. Customer Insights – Data connects data from various transactional, behavioral, and observational sources into a single unified customer profile to provide a 360-degree customer view. Use these insights to drive customer-centric experiences and processes.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales:

Dynamics 365 Sales empowers sellers to build strong customer relationships and close deals faster. Digital selling tools help sellers better understand which customers and sales opportunities they should be focusing on. It provides every seller in your organization with the capability to analyze, act, and automate digital selling across your organization to transform their approach to selling from the ground up. The Sales application is available in several options to provide each organization with the functionalities needed for their business:

Dynamics 365 Sales Professional: A lighter weight sales management application designed for small to mid-size businesses that need solid customer relationship and sales management capabilities.

Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise: Enterprise grade sales and customer management solutions, providing robust, guided sales processes and automation in a digital age.

Dynamics 365 Sales Premium: The most complete sales management and engagement offering, with Microsoft’s powerful AI capabilities woven throughout, to drive significant business outcomes and performance in a sales organization.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service:

Dynamics 365 Customer Service empowers your support staff to provide enhanced assistance to your customers. It provides you with everything needed to manage the complete end-to-end lifecycle of support requests reported by customers. From the initial case creation and management, to developing knowledge management solutions, Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps organizations ensure that customer issues are being handled quickly and effectively.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center:

Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot-first cloud platform that integrates generative AI across the entire customer support journey. It supports both digital and voice channels and is designed to work with any CRM system, including not only Dynamics 365, but Salesforce, or even custom-built solutions. Some key capabilities included in Contact Center include:

AI-powered self-service: Chatbots and virtual assistants that understand context and intent.

Intelligent routing: Automatically directs inquiries to the most suitable agent.

Agent productivity tools: These tools include suggested responses, conversation summaries, and a unified knowledge interface.

Supervisor tools: These tools include real-time dashboards, performance metrics, and session monitoring.

Composability: Built on Microsoft Dataverse, Contact Center integrates with existing data and applications

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service:

Dynamics 365 Field Service provides organizations with the tools necessary to deliver onsite services to their customers and manage their mobile workforce. Dynamics 365 Field Service helps equip technicians with what they need to increase first-time fix rates. Dynamics 365 Field Service provides tools that help you:

create work orders

schedule and dispatch technicians

execute on work orders

manage and service assets

manage inventory and billing

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations:

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations helps project-based organizations connect sales, staffing and resourcing, project management, and finance teams in a single application. That capability helps to accelerate project delivery and maximize profitability. It provides organizations with the tools they need to control projects using either traditional waterfall or agile methodologies. Dynamics 365 Project Operations manages resources by providing accurate information for analysis of resource allocations and utilizations. Project Operations helps organizations do the following more effectively:

Project-based selling: Organizations who sell projects can manage every aspect of the project selling process. While the sales cycle length and project costing make project-based selling different from typical product-based selling, Dynamics 365 Project Operations uses the same core sales record types used by Dynamics 365 sales to support product-based selling scenarios. This provides a common experience for organizations that might do both project-based and product-based selling.

Project management: Project managers are equipped with the tools they need to be successful managing projects tasks. These tasks include task management, project and resource scheduling, creating interactive Gantt charts and work-breakdown structures. These tools help develop accurate estimates for labor, expenses, and materials, and track planned-vs-actual consumption as projects progress. Extensive reporting tools and built-in insights ensure you understand how projects are trending and help to drive timely decisions for course correction.

Project resource management: Resource managers are equipped with the tools they need to successfully manage project resources. They can easily book resources with their project schedule assignments. Skill and proficiency repositories make it easy to identify which resources are qualified to work on different project tasks. Extensive resource management tools help you identify how resources are being assigned. This capability ensures that they're being used on the right types of projects and that they aren't being over extended.

When used alone, each application empowers organizations to manage the daily aspects related to that item. For example, Dynamics 365 Sales helps you take control of, manage, and automate the tasks related to your sales cycle. However, when combined with Dynamics 365 Customer Service, you now have a complete solution that ensures you're providing high levels of service to your customers after they're sold. Service-related events can be used to trigger sales-related events to get sellers out selling to customers. Even though each application provides a specific type of functionality, they each share common elements to provide a unified experience whether you're using them separately or together.

As a next step, let’s take a closer look at how the different applications can be accessed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how companies do business. Not only can it provide organizations with important insights, but it also helps streamline how individuals do their work. Microsoft’s Copilot uses AI to allow individuals to communicate their needs using natural language and provides them with relevant assistance based on the details they provide.

Copilot can be used throughout Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications. Copilot can help users easily retrieve information about their customers and streamline things such as data entry and task completion.

Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales

Copilot for Sales is an AI assistant designed for sellers to maximize productivity and close more deals. It brings next-generation AI and sales insights from their CRM platform into the Microsoft 365 productivity tools that they use daily like Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Word.

Sellers can work more efficiently and improve customer experiences with email assistance, personalized sales content creation, AI-generated insights, and recommendations for next steps. Sales managers can empower their teams with AI-powered manager insights and collaboration tools. Copilot for Sales can also be customized according to your business needs. Copilot for Sales integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Salesforce Sales Cloud and can be configured to connect to other sales solutions.

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Copilot is an AI assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales that helps sales teams be more productive and efficient in their daily work. It has a chat interface that helps sellers quickly summarize their opportunity and lead records, stay updated on recent changes, prepare for meetings, and read the latest news about their accounts. Sellers can chat with Copilot in natural language or use predefined prompts to get the information they need.

Record summarization

The Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales record summarization feature provides a quick summary of your opportunity and lead records. Summaries are generated from the fields in the default opportunity or lead view. As users start typing the opportunity or lead name after the @ symbol, Copilot suggests records that match your search. Select the record for which you want a summary.

The following screenshot is an example of an opportunity summary generated by Copilot in Sales:

Email assistance

Copilot is also used to help compose professional-looking emails, responding to emails, and get email follow-up reminders. Copilot uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to help create emails messages. You simply describe the email you want to create to Copilot, and it generates a draft email. The draft can be edited as needed before sending it to a customer.

Sales Research Agent

The Sales Research Agent is an AI-powered assistant that is designed to help streamline lead qualification and outreach by automation research and content generation. For example, the research agent searches through both internal and external information to obtain details about the lead. It then summarizes that information to simplify the research process. From there, it drafts personalized emails based on the research it conducted.

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service

In support scenarios, the faster that you can identify appropriate information about a case, the easier it can be to resolve the customer’s issue. Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps organizations more effectively summarize data.

There are two primary elements related to summarization:

Summarize cases: Copilot case summaries help support agents quickly understand the context of a case and resolve customer issues more efficiently. The case summary includes key information such as the case title, customer, subject, product, priority, case type, and description.

Summarize conversations: Copilot conversation summaries provide context and relay the steps that you've already taken to solve the issue. You can summarize chat and transcribed voice conversations.

The image shows an example of a case summary that was created.

Autonomous agents in Dynamics 365 Customer Service

As AI evolves, the ways it is being used to impact business are evolving as well. One significant advancement is the rise of autonomous agents. An autonomous agent is an AI system designed to operate independently, make decisions, and adapt to its environment without constant human input. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, several autonomous agents assist representatives with tasks ranging from case creation and management to knowledge generation. Currently, there are three autonomous agents available:

Case Management Agent: This agent assists representatives by automatically creating cases from chat conversations and incoming emails. It uses AI predictions to populate case fields and can automatically follow up and close cases.

Customer Knowledge Management Agent: This agent autonomously converts case-related content into knowledge articles. When a case is closed, it evaluates existing content to determine whether a new knowledge article is necessary. If so, it automatically recommends and creates the article.

Customer Intent Agent: This agent autonomously identifies, manages, and acts on customer intents across both self-service and agent-assisted channels. It analyzes historical interactions and offers intent-based suggestions to representatives.

Copilot for Service

For many organizations, their service centers utilize multiple applications and data sources to provide support to their customers. Copilot for Service is a standalone product that provides them with the ability to connect all their data including CRM, contact center systems, and other sources to fuel AP-powered conversations without needing to replace their existing solution.

Out-of-the-box integrations with services such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk not only let you leverage that information in generative answers, but you can also deploy the tool applications that your agents are using every day.

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service capabilities

The initial release of Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service focuses on simplifying work order creation. Organizations that use the Dynamics 365 Field Service app for Outlook can easily create work orders directly from incoming emails. Copilot considers information in the email such as who it is from and what the customer is requesting. Copilot configures Field Service data and populates a suggestion for the field service work order record. Users can either accept the suggestion and create a work order, or they can modify the data and then create a work order. Either way, Copilot suggestions can reduce the amount of time that it takes to enter work orders in the system.

Schedule Operations Agent

The Scheduling Operations Agent in Dynamics 365 Field Service helps dispatchers quickly and efficiently optimize the schedule of a technician. It addresses common scheduling challenges by using AI to suggest intelligent updates based on real-time conditions. For example, if a technician experiences same-day cancellations, the agent can recommend nearby work orders that align with promised times and priorities. If a technician is running behind schedule, the agent can help adjust the remaining bookings to minimize delays.

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Journeys

In Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Copilot can, for instance, help create customer journeys. An organization might want to create a welcome journey for people that recently joined your organization’s loyalty program. With Copilot journeys, you can describe the journey that you want to create or select from different examples. Copilot processes the prompt and responds with a journey suggestion that includes the automatically detected segment and each subsequent step clearly.

Customers

Customers are a critical part of any Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution. A customer represents an individual or company that receives, consumes, or buys a product or service.

There are three ways organizations might use customers:

Business-to-Business (B2B): Customers are other businesses. For example, a business that sells and implements telecommunication equipment to hotels.

Business-to-Consumer (B2C): Customers are individuals. You likely meet these businesses every day. You engage with them by purchasing groceries, getting a haircut, or stopping at a favorite coffee shop.

Hybrid: Customers might be either businesses or individuals. For example, an automotive repair shop certainly has customers who are individuals. Customers go there to get their oil changed, tires rotated, engines overhauled, and so on. What if that automotive business outsources its mechanics to organizations with fleets of trucks, buses, or automobiles as well? In this example, they service both organizations and people. Other examples might include software vendors, event centers, and insurance companies.

Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps support all three customer models. There are two primary records used to support this functionality:

Account: Represents a company or an organization that you do business with, such as a customer, vendor, partner, or reseller.

Contact: Represents a person. A contact can be a standalone person, or an individual at an organization.

Accounts and contacts can be related to one another in various ways. Individual contacts can be associated with an account. For example, if Microsoft were an account within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 system, then the contacts might include Bill Gates. Each contact record in Dynamics 365 includes the parent customer field that allows you to link a contact to a specific account record.

While an account might have multiple contacts, it's likely that it has a primary contact. The primary contact represents a key person at the organization that you primarily deal with. This primary contact might be the person you deal with as it relates to billing, sales, and so on.

While many accounts are standalone accounts, there are occasions when an account can be considered as the parent account to another account. This relationship occurs when one account is a division or subsidiary of a parent company.

The image shows what this might look like.

Activities

Activities in Dynamics 365 help keep track of customer communications. For example, as you work with customers, you might do things like take notes, send emails, make phone calls, set up appointments, or assign yourself tasks as you resolve a service case. By entering these activities in Dynamics 365, you have a historic record of your communication with customers.

Activities are often associated with contacts and accounts but, depending on the Dynamics 365 application you're using, they can also be associated with other types of records.

In sales scenarios, activities might be added to records like leads, opportunities, or quotes.

In service scenarios, activities might be added to records like cases, work orders, or projects.

As your organization's relationship with a customer grows over time, you and other people on your team can look through the record timeline to see the history of your interactions.

Describe search criteria and filters
3 minutes

As the number of records in Dynamics 365 grows, you need to be able quickly locate and access records, such as when a customer calls with a question related to their account.

Dynamics 365 provides multiple ways to locate data depending on where you are and what you're looking for. If you are working in a view, you can easily filter the list of records displayed with the filter options available for each column displayed.

For example, in the image below we're using the filter control on the City column to filter only the accounts that are in Redmond.

You can filter based on multiple columns at once if needed. Any applied filters can be removed by selecting the filter icon on the column.

Filtering provides a quick way to get broad results when locating data. However, there are many times when it's easier to search for a record directly. In these instances, you can use the search options available.

The two most common searching tools are:

Filter by keyword: This option is often referred to as Quick Find and is available on any Dynamics 365 view. You provide the first several letters of the item you're looking for, and the results are returned directly in the view. Consider this scenario: You review the list of active account records and type “Adventure” into the search field. As a result, you see all the account records that have “Adventure” at the beginning.

Multi-table search: This search tool is often referred to as Categorized Search. The primary difference between multi-table search and a quick find is that instead of only searching one type of record, multi-table searches across multiple tables defined by the organization. In this instance, if you enter Adventure, you're presented with all accounts that begin with Adventure. You're also provided with a list of any contacts associated with an account that begins with the word Adventure.

There are times when you can't find what you are looking for by using the standard filtering and searching options. For instance, while working in Dynamics 365 Sales, you might need to locate all the accounts with open opportunities. Standard filtering doesn't work in this case since you need to filter based on multiple entities. You then need to use the edit filter option. This allows you to create detailed filters that can span multiple entities. The edit filter icon is located just to the left of the quick find search box.

Advanced find

Another way that you can locate data in Dynamics 365 apps is with Advanced find. Advanced find is a simple query designer that allows you to visually create a query that displays all records that match the criteria defined. You can also use Advanced find to prepare data for export to Office Excel so that you can analyze, summarize, or aggregate data, or create PivotTables to view your data.

In the image, the Advanced find filter displays all active accounts owned by the current user.

Dynamics 365 provides multiple reporting options available out of the box to provide users with some basic reporting on their data. All the reporting options in Dynamics 365 CRM apps are configurable and enforce established security roles for data access.

Views

When you create views, you create analytics based on the data that is important to you. When you view records, you can apply filters to drill down into the detail that is important to you.

Charts

Charts are quick and actionable visualizations of your data. The charts are interactive so you can continue to drill down into relevant data. You can also place charts on dashboards and view them in line with the data they're displaying.

Dashboards

Both standard and interactive dashboards offer a combination of charts and views in an easy to consume experience.

Dashboards are a collection of:

Views

Charts

Iframe

Web resources

The advantage of dashboards is that you can easily obtain a high-level overview of data all in one diagram. Based on the first party application that you're using, there are different dashboard options available.

The screenshot shows an example of a Dynamics 365 Sales dashboard.

Power BI

There are times when the out-of-the-box reporting tools available in the Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps don't meet the needs of an organization. In those instances, Power BI reports can be built from Dynamics 365 data. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Once created, Power BI dashboards can be embedded in Dynamics 365 applications. This makes it easy for users to not only use the capabilities provided by the out-of-the-box reports as needed, but also allows them to access more advanced reporting through embedded Power BI reports.

As you're working in the application, you can select the Analyze in Power BI button at any time. You then create a Power BI report based on the selected data. You can easily filter the information based on what you want to see.

There are many different scenarios where Dynamics 365 and Office can work together. Users can use Microsoft Word to simplify sending communication to customers, and Microsoft Excel can be used to provide more detailed end user capabilities.

Microsoft Excel

The integration between model-driven apps and Excel is a favorite feature for many users. Excel is one of the most popular data analysis tools for business users, and the ease of exporting Dataverse data to Excel is a significant benefit for users at all levels of an organization.

Static and dynamic worksheets

Most Dynamics 365 views can be exported as static or dynamic data into Excel. Static worksheets create a local copy of the data, and no connection is maintained between Dataverse workbooks. Exported dynamic workbooks or pivot tables maintain a link between the Dataverse data and the Excel file. The Dataverse security model is maintained, and users need appropriate privileges to refresh the data.

Another export option is exporting to Excel Online. This option opens the Excel file for the user in a window within Dynamics 365 or custom model-driven apps. This option is popular when someone wants to quickly edit multiple Dynamics 365 records.

Excel Templates

Like Word document templates, Excel templates empower Dynamics 365 users to easily create up to date Excel reports without needing knowledge of Excel formulas, charts, or pivot tables. Templates can be opened in Excel online or downloaded, and then opened locally in Excel. Templates allow users who would usually be unable to create these reports to easily use premade Excel documents with current data. It also empowers Excel users to create reports with current data instead of maintaining their own data outside the system.

Microsoft Word

Like using templates in Microsoft Excel, users can use Word templates to simplify communication with customers. Word templates can be used in all customer engagement apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The templates provide users with a one-click way to generate standardized documents automatically populated with data.

Microsoft SharePoint is used by organizations across the world for document management. It provides many features that are beneficial when collaborating on documents such as document check in and out functionality, and versioning. These features provide deeper document management capabilities than the attachment options that are available in Dynamics 365 CRM applications.

With Dataverse, organizations can store documents on Microsoft SharePoint and manage them from within your Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. This capability allows you to take full advantage of SharePoint document management capabilities since all the documents you create in your app are stored on SharePoint. Not only does this mean that your documents are automatically synced to your desktop and mobile devices, but they're also accessible for collaboration with non-Dynamics 365 users.

Once integration is turned on, Dynamics 365 users can:

Create new folders for storing files directly in SharePoint

Create new documents

Upload existing documents

Open the SharePoint site directly, which provides you with the ability to:

Check documents in and out

Use SharePoint's versioning capabilities

Modern marketers need smarter ways to find the right prospects and build long-lasting relationships. Customer Insights - Journeys was designed to help you and your organization identify the right leads and nurture them into becoming customers. Customer Insights - Journeys lets you run multi-channel marketing campaigns to attract the right prospects. These campaigns can include email, web, events, text messaging, and custom channels. For example, a real estate company can create customer segments in Customer Insights - Journeys that represent younger families looking to purchase homes in a specific zip code. We can send them targeted marketing emails. As buyers open and interact with those emails, links to specific marketing content provide them with more information based on what they select. This content might include what they should be looking for in a home, information on financing. The information could also contain details about what is available in the area they're looking at.

Customer Insights - Journeys provides multiple features as part of its core functionality that helps identify and target your marketing efforts and maximize your potential for success.

These capabilities include:

Generating and identifying potential sales opportunities as leads and scoring those lead to identify the ones to focus on.

Defining marketing segments that organize contacts from your database into logical groups that match your marketing strategies.

Creating personalized marketing content that can be sent to contacts that meet legal and deliverability requirements.

Creating fully automated customer journeys that combine digital engagement with multiple paths managed by interactive triggers.

Creating and managing marketing events including defining the event type, building schedules, and securing sponsors, and managing event registrations.

Real-time marketing

Real-time marketing is often referred to as customer journey orchestration. Real-time marketing allows you to trigger customer journeys in real time based on the signals and rich profile data you collect from your customers. The data ensures that the triggered customer journey picks the right channel for each individual and connects in the moments that matter. For example, you could have a customer journey triggered when someone connects to the Wi-Fi at your coffee shop, or when someone visits your company's website.

Some of the key benefits of real-time marketing include:

Engage customers in real-time

With trigger-based customer journeys using email, text message, or push notification channels, organizations can trigger customer journeys in real time. They can pick the right channel for each individual, and react to customer-led actions in the moments that matter.

Win customers and earn loyalty faster

Real-time customer journeys are truly an end-to-end experience as they work across all customer touchpoints.

Personalize customer experiences with AI

Turn insights into relevant action with AI-driven recommendations for content, channels, and analytics.

Customer Insights segment and profile integration allows organizations to seamlessly use the deep customer understanding in Customer Insights.

Grow with a unified, adaptable platform

Easily customize and connect with tools you already use.

Efficiently manage compliance requirements and accessibility guidelines.

When reaching out to your customers with Customer Insights - Journeys, there are three important things to consider: who, what, and when.

The who is your audience – who is this communication for? In Customer Insights - Journeys, a segment defines your audience. This segment is a subset of your contacts that meet some criteria. For example, you could have a segment containing customers over the age of 60 who live in North America. You could have a segment for customers who earn more than $100,000 per year, or a blanket segment with all your active contacts. Learn more about segments: Build segments in Customer Insights - Journeys.

The what is the content and form of your communication - what are you sending? In Customer Insights - Journeys, this can be an email, a push notification, or a text message. These channels can be used separately or together in one campaign. Learn more about channels:

Create an email

Create a push notification

Create a text message

The when can be as straightforward as a planned time when you want to send the communication, but with Customer Insights - Journeys, it can also be an event that triggers the communication as part of a journey. You can combine emails, push notifications, and text messages into journeys. Those journeys can operate over either a segment of contacts at a planned time or that can respond to a trigger to reach customers in the moments that matter. Learn more about journeys:

Email is a key marketing channel for most modern organizations. Not only does it let you reach large numbers of customers in a short amount of time, but it’s easy to tailor message content to provide a personal experience for customers receiving it.

Marketing emails is another core feature of the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys application. It lets you send large volumes of personalized marketing emails, monitor how recipients interact with them, drive customer journey automation, and present aggregated statistical results for individual contacts. For example, Contoso Coffee can use the email marketing capabilities to create targeted email messages for things such as launching specific products, highlight special promotions, or even brand promotion. These messages are easily delivered through targeted customer journeys.

Organizations can offer customers the ability to subscribe to an unlimited number of relevant topics while obtaining necessary consent to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Customers can then opt in to receive marketing subscriptions such as "Newsletters," "Community Events," or "Product Discounts." Once you create topics, you can collect consent from new customers using flexible options on marketing forms. These options allow you to gather consent either explicitly (through visible fields) or implicitly (through hidden fields). Real-time marketing automatically enforces topic checks without the need to create and manage subscription lists of contacts.

The email designer in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys provides a visual design interface that lets you:

Add, configure, and arrange various text and graphical elements your email requires.

Design the overall message with basic fonts, colors, and backgrounds.

Add dynamic content email messages such as adding a contact’s first or last name to the body of your email.

Add links to external webpages, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys pages, event registration pages, surveys, and more.

After your marketing emails are created, they're ready to send. Emails in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys are implemented through customer journeys.

Describe how to target customers by using marketing lists and segments
10 minutes

A typical marketing campaign is focused on your organization’s product or services. The goal is to target customers who would benefit the most from or have the greatest interest in what you are marketing. For that reason, one of the first and most important decisions to make when designing marketing pieces is choosing the correct audience. Once you understand who your audience is, you can tailor your messaging and marketing approach to best appeal to that group of people.

A marketing segment is a group of related contacts to target marketing initiatives through customer journeys. Marketing segments are created using the segment designer. The segment designer allows you to search for contact across different related entities, such as contacts, leads, accounts, events, and marketing lists. For example, you could create a segment that only includes contacts from accounts that are in the manufacturing industry. You might also create a segment for contacts that participated in a specific event. When building a segment, you can choose to target contacts, leads, or unified profiles from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data.

Segments can be easily created based on different qualification factors to ensure that you're marketing services to the correct customer base.

One advantage of real-time marketing is that you can create dynamic segments that target leads directly without having to connect it to a parent contact. This means that you can target leads directly. This provides extra capabilities when you're using lead scoring models. Real-time marketing segments can return tables, such as contacts or leads. But you can also build more complex queries that reference tables such as Event Registration or Account to further enrich your segment definition. For example, you an identify leads whose parent accounts are in the Customer Service industry.

To simplify creating segments in real-time marketing, you can use the Query Assist Copilot to describe the segment definition in simple English. For example, you could tell Query Assist that you want to create a segment for people who attended a recent event. The Query Assist Copilot lets you add the results query onto the segment builder at any level of the query logic. You can add the results query either as a new group or as another condition in your existing logic.

In this clickthrough demonstration, you're guided through the process of creating a marketing segment using Query Assist Copilot. Segments can be used with other features such as email marketing.

A customer journey is a path a customer takes while interacting with your organization's marketing process. The goal of a completed journey is to generate revenue.

For example, a simple customer journey might look like this:

A potential customer opens a marketing email they received from Contoso Coffee.

The email includes multiple links the customer can click on to learn more about the different Contoso products highlighted in the email.

They're directed to a marketing page related to that product, based on the link they select.

The customer indicates they would like some additional information about the product they selected while they're on the marketing page.

The customer is sent targeted marketing materials, based on the request. A task is assigned to a Contoso Coffee sales associate to follow up with potential customers within a day or two, aiming to convert them into revenue.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys lets you create powerful customer journeys tailored to the products you're marketing and the objectives of your campaign. You can easily visualize and automate the journey customers take while interacting with your sales and marketing processes. From emails and task assignments to business workflows, decision points, and internal action items, journeys can be customized based on customer needs and preferences.

With customer journeys, you can:

engage customers in real time.

With trigger-based customer journeys using email, text message, or push notification channels, organizations can trigger customer journeys in real time. They can pick the right channel for each individual and react to customer-led actions in the moments that matter.

win customers and earn loyalty faster.

Working across all customer touchpoints, real-time customer journeys are truly an end-to-end experience.

personalize customer experiences with AI.

Turn insights into relevant action with AI-driven recommendations for content, channels, and analytics.
Customer Insights - Data segment and profile integration allows organizations to seamlessly apply the deep customer understanding in Customer Insights - Data.

grow with a unified, adaptable platform.

Easily customize and connect with tools you already use.
Efficiently manage compliance requirements and accessibility guidelines.

To get started, a basic customer journey needs at least two pieces of information:

Customers to target: You should have a segment containing the contacts to whom you want to send your email.

Marketing activities: You should include a marketing email that is both valid and live.

Depending on your desired complexity and specific goals, a customer journey can include various elements to guide engaged customers. These are represented in the journey’s visual designer as tiles.

Trigger-based journeys

Triggers represent actions taken by a customer such as a whitepaper download, a form submitted, or a Wi-Fi sign-up. They can also represent significant business events, such as a purchase that shipped or completion of an enrollment process. Trigger-based journeys are effective because they represent the ability to perform more targeted marketing based on customer-related interactions and events.

Real-time marketing offers three types of triggers in the triggers catalog:

Custom triggers: These are triggers defined by real-time marketing users. They provide a flexible way to capture any customer action or significant business event.

Interaction triggers: These triggers are customer interactions with journey elements such as email, text message, and push channels. They don’t start or stop journeys. They're used within a journey and represent a logical continuation of a preceding step. When a journey sends an email, triggers like Email delivered, Email bounced, or Email opened become available to journey authors, helping them decide the next steps.

Business triggers: These triggers represent changes in Dynamics 365 applications such as Sales or Service. These changes can reflect either the creation of a new record or an update to an existing one. A business trigger occurs when a contact is created or when an email address, phone number, or physical address is updated.

Another way you can create customer journeys is with the Customer Insights - Journeys copilot. With the journey copilot, you can use everyday conversational language to create marketing journeys without requiring deep knowledge about the product. For example, you might say something like, after a landing page is completed, send the customer a thank you message to the contact in their preferred channel. Then wait two days and send a survey.

This lab simulation steps you through the process of creating a customer journey, both with and without using Microsoft Copilot.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys helps you plan, automate, and monitor the full customer journey. Prospects travel from discovery, through nurturing, and onward to become marketing-qualified or sales-ready leads. As your organization engages with leads through different marketing initiatives, not all individuals are going to respond the same. Some leads naturally identify with your organization and are more likely to respond to communication they receive. Others aren't as invested and don't respond or engage as often. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys allows you to prioritize leads. You can achieve this using customizable lead scoring rules. These rules help identify the most engaged leads based on their interactions with your marketing campaigns.

There are various features that are part of lead scoring, including:

Features to identify the best prospects and hand them off to the sales team.

Lead scoring
Lead qualification

Features to capture demand.

Lead and opportunity creation in journeys

Features to assign work to your sales team.

Task creation in journeys
Phone call creation in journeys
Sales activities creation in journeys

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys helps you to nurture and prioritize those leads. You can run targeted, multi-channel campaigns, and personalize each customer’s journey to generate more sales-ready leads. By personalizing the customer experience, you can predict the customer’s intent, get a holistic view of your customers, and orchestrate a connected, personalized journey.

The following screenshot is a lead qualification screen.

For example, as Contoso Coffee runs it’s A1-100 campaigns, customers engage and interact with the marketing materials being sent. Contoso can assign point values for each interaction. An email open might be five points, registering for a webinar might be 15 points, and so on. Once the customer reaches 100 points, they would be deemed as a sales ready lead and sent to the sales staff.

By generating customized sales activities, you can seamlessly integrate your marketing and sales efforts, providing a more cohesive and streamlined experience for your leads and customers. By creating sales activities directly from real-time journeys, you can better track and measure the effectiveness of your marketing and sales efforts and make data-driven decisions to optimize your campaigns for maximum impact.

Another way you can market to individuals more effectively is with contact and lead insights. With lead and contact insights, you see a complete history of how selected leads and contacts interacted with your marketing initiatives. This can help you to understand what this specific contact is interested in and which types of messages they respond to. Marketers can utilize this information to gain deeper insights into specific decision makers. This helps them target future initiatives more effectively. On the other hand, salespeople can use this information to determine the most effective way to communicate with the same person if they decide to reach out directly.

Live events and webinars are a vital sales and marketing channel. But events and webinars can be complex to arrange, execute, and follow up on. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys changes that situation. It helps you every step of the way:

initial planning and budgeting
promotion and publication
attendee registration
webinar broadcasting
final analytics
lead generation
evaluation of Return on Investment (ROI)

It creates a single data silo location for event management integrated into sales and marketing business processes. You manage and process all the event details through the same portal location, resulting in an integrated event management process.

To get started planning an event such, as a webinar for Contoso Coffee’s latest coffee machine, in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, you create an event record. The event record has all your planning details, includes links to related records, and gives you a business-process timeline. The timeline guides you through each step of the event planning process.

Once you have an event record, you set up your event team, manage speakers and sessions, set up event passes, and set up a venue. You control every aspect of the event, from the initial planning and budgeting, through promotion and publication, to attendee registration and final analytics.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys event management lets you:

Design the right event: The event designer lets you create the right event based on your organizational goals and factors such as the intended audience, type of event, and desired business outcomes.

Event logistics, such as location details, fees, and other logistical data can be tracked and measured as the event is being built.

Create the right agenda: Define every session that is offered throughout the event. You can track important details such as where the session is located, type of session, target audiences, and who is delivering the session.

Sessions can be added to event tracks to make it easy for attendees to locate sessions that are most important to them.

Manage speakers and sponsors: Keep track on the individuals and organizations that are helping to make your event happen. Track important details speaker sessions, individual or organization bios, and manage costs and expenses related to them.

Manage registrations: Easily manage who is planning on attending your event. Event passes and packages can be created to help provide the best experience possible to attendees.

Through attendance history, you can evaluate sessions popularity and use that information to help dictate future offerings.

Improve event experience: During the event, easily manage and publish important changes to sessions, tracks, and speakers directly to the event website.

Drive sales activities: Attendance information from participants can be used in marketing campaigns to generate leads and help drive future revenue.

Clickthrough demo: Manage an Event

In this clickthrough demonstration, you're guided through what an event manager would experience while managing events in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys.

Manage an Event

As you saw, with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, event managers have all the tools they need to successfully manage and deliver both in-person and virtual events. They can manage everything from the venues to speakers, and schedules. With integrated event portal, attendees can easily register for events and manage their schedules after they're registered.

In Customer Insights – Journeys, Copilot can be used to help create and manage your marketing campaigns using everyday language. It simplifies processes and empowers you to reach customers more effectively. Copilot can be used to tailor your customer journeys and provide a user-friendly way to connect with customers at every touchpoint.

With Copilot in Customer Insights – Journeys, you can:

Target the right customers: With Copilot's Query Assist feature, you can describe your segment criteria in natural language and let Copilot create segments for you. For example, you can type "customers who bought shoes in the last month."

For example, you can type "show me images of shoes on sale" and Copilot displays a gallery of images to choose from.

Refresh and perfect your message: Copilot excels at understanding the context of the provided content. When you give Copilot a passage to rewrite, it considers the surrounding text, grasping the tone, intent, and specific nuances. For example, you can type "revise this paragraph for a more formal tone" and Copilot intelligently interprets your instructions and provide dynamic content suggestions.

Take advantage of AI-assisted themes: With AI-assisted themes, you can define the visual appeal of your emails effortlessly by describing your preferences using natural language and Copilot takes care of the rest. For example, you can type "create a friendly and inviting look for this message," and Copilot transforms your vision into a stunning email theme.

A typical organization has customer data scattered across different data repositories. For example, sales-related data might be stored in their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, and a customer’s purchase history might be stored in their Point-of-Sale (POS) system. By having these different, disconnected data sources, you risk not gaining a clear picture of who your customer is. As a result, it makes it challenging to meet the individual needs of each customer throughout their entire journey with your company.

Customer Insights - Data brings together your organization’s transactional, behavioral, and demographic data across all your data silos to create a 360-degree view of your customers. You can analyze customer interactions and usage with cross-channel analytics and harness the data to drive informed decisions, automate processes, and personalize customer engagement across channels.

At a high level, this process looks like:

Ingest data into Customer Insights - Data: Define the data sources that your data is coming from. Data can be ingested from a wide range of data sources through built-in connectors that connect to many different data providers.

Create customer profiles: Customer profiles are created through unifying the data ingested from your different data sources into a single profile.

The unification process includes:

Profile mapping: This is where you identify which tables and fields from your data are used to identify the customer record such as a customer number.

Matching: When matching, you define rules to merge your data sets into a single unified profile. These rules determine which fields from each dataset are used in the matching process.

Merge into a unified profile: This step completes the process and reconciles any conflicts that might be present.

Define activities: Activities help to consolidate your customer activities across data sources and put them into a timeline view. These activities might represent things like interactions, or purchases.

Enrich your data: Enrichment uses data from other sources to help you better track brand affiliation and loyalty across hundreds of different brands and several interest categories.

Define measures: These measures are the KPIs that best reflect the performance and health of your business. The KPIs might represent satisfaction levels, revenue targets, or performance levels.

Create segments: With segments, you can easily group your customers based on demographic, transactional, or behavioral customer attributes.

Activate Customer Insights – Data in other applications: Using data in other apps is the main purpose of Customer Insights – Data. You can take items like the segments that you created and consume them in other applications such as Google Ads, Customer Insights – Journeys, and more.

By utilizing Customer Insights - Data, your organization can create more targeted customer segments. These segments are based on data from all your organization’s sources, including enriched data that provides specific brand and demographic information. This means that by analyzing relevant data, your organization can better understand its customers and tailor its strategies accordingly.

The first part of any Customer Data Platform (CDP) solution is to provide a consolidated view of customers. By collecting as much data as possible from your organization’s different data sources, you can unify it into a single view of the customer. Many people think of this process as creating a digital twin of your customers. This digital twin understands the digital touch points a customer has with your organization. Every digital activity, such as an email that a customer sends or receives, creates an engagement data point that helps you build a more complete digital twin of your customer.

In addition to understanding the digital activities, to truly gain a 360-degree view of a customer, you need to understand the context of who they are. By considering information like their location, income, or family size, you can better understand who that person is. This level of understanding is often done with the help of enrichment data that can fill in the gaps left by your internal data sources. Enrichment data might include details such as brand affinities, hobbies, financial details, and other demographic information.

The image shows an illustration on the digital twin concept.

As seen in the image, each digital activity captured such as emails, ads they interact with, and social media interactions help to make the "digital twin" picture clearer. This picture is further enhanced by including things such as their hobbies, number of children, and brand loyalties. With a clear and complete "digital twin" that represents who your customers are, you can use that information to gain deeper insights about who they are. These insights help you provide deeper, more personalized experiences.

Customer Insights - Data helps your organization unlock insights, build deeper understandings of your customers, and power personalized customer experiences by unifying your customer data from all your organizations various transactional, behavioral, and observational data sources into a single 360-degree view of the customer. The first part of this process is through data ingestion.

Customer profiles are created by unifying data ingested from your organization's different data sources. Data can be ingested from a wide range of data sources through built-in connectors that connect to many different data providers.

Data can be ingested into Customer Insights - Data in the following ways:

Microsoft Power Query: Used when you want to import data such as Microsoft Dataverse, Azure Blobs, OData sources, etc. For more information, see Power Query Connectors.

Azure Synapse Analytics (preview): Used when you want to connect to Azure Synapse Analytics. For more information, see Connect an Azure Synapse data source.

Azure data lake storage: - Used when you want to connect to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 Account. For more information, see Common Data Folder.

Microsoft Dataverse: - Used when you want to connect to data sets in the Dataverse data lake. For more information, see Dataverse.

Azure Data Lake Delta tables: Used when you want to connect to data in Delta tables. For more information, see Connect to Delta tables in Azure Data Lake Storage.

Once you identify the customer data that you want to use in your unified customer profile, you need to unify the data. The Customer Insights data unification process includes the following steps:

Source columns - Defines which tables and columns are combined to create a unified customer profile.

Duplicate records - Defines how to handle any duplicate records in your datasets.

Matching conditions - Defines the rules that are used to help combine your datasets into a unified customer profile.

Unify customer columns - Defines final information such as which items to exclude, column ranking, and other details that could impact the merge.

Clickthrough demo: Create a Unified Customer Profile

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Data lets you easily consolidate the transactional, organizational, and behavioral data from all your organization's different data silos and combine it into a single unified customer profile. In this clickthrough demo, we demonstrate the process of creating a unified customer profile.

After Customer Insights - Data is configured, any user who has a Customer Insights license can access the application. When you first launch the application, it opens the Customer Insights - Data home page, which provides a holistic view of your customer base showing metrics that help you track the overall health of your business.

The types of insights that you can expect to view on the home page are shown in the following image.

From the main menu in Customer Insights - Data, you have access to all the different application features, based on your needs.

The main menu provides you with access to the following capabilities:

Home - Provides a central overview of available insights and segmentation data that is defined for your organization.

Customers - Provides access to individual customer cards based on unified customer profiles.

Data - Used to ingest data from different data sources to create a unified customer profile. The data section also lets you define the following parameters:

Data sources - Displays a list of the different data sources that are ingested into Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Data.

Unify - Used to unify your data from different sources into a single customer profile.

Enrichment - Unlocks data on affinities for hundreds of brands and dozens of interest categories. These affinities are extracted for profiles that might be like your customers.

Activities - Lets you take activities from different sources and make them available together in chronological order.

Tables - Displays the different tables that are in your Customer Insights – Data deployment, based on the different elements you configure.

Exports - Provides you with access to the different exports you're using.

Insights - Provides access to tools used to provide insights about your organization.

Segments - Lets you define how to group and categorize customers based on similar demographic, transactional, or behavioral attributes.

Measures - Defines key business and customer KPIs such as customer lifetime value, average purchase value and frequency, and CSAT, and identifies high-value customers.

Predictions - Provides access to the different AI elements that are available to use as part of your deployment.

Settings - Provides access to different application settings that you can use for administrative purposes.

System - Provides access to different environmental settings that can be modified based on your specific needs.

Permissions - Provides access to configure application permissions.

Connections - Used to set up and configure different export destinations for customer segments.

Once you have consolidated your data into a single unified customer profile, there are several elements in Customer Insights – Data that help you provide your organization with a clearer picture of who your customers are.

Those elements are:

Activities – Transactional data that represents how your customers are interacting with your organization such as customer purchases, visits to a website, or a case opened by a customer.

Measures - Define the key business and customer KPIs such as customer lifetime value, average purchase value and frequency, and CSAT, and identifies high-value customers.

Segments – Allow you to specify what you want to group and categorize your customers based on similar demographic, transactional, or behavioral attributes. The advantage of segments in Customer Insights – Data is that you can enrich your customer data with data from external sources, and build segments based on that data.

Predictions - Provides access to the different AI elements that are available to use as part of your deployment.

Measures

Customer Insights - Data includes three different measure types that can be created. Depending on which type of measure that you define, they can be used in different parts of the application.

The three types of measures are:

Customer attribute - These measures represent a single field for each customer. They typically reflect a score, value, or state such as a customer's lifetime value, total sales, or average purchase value.

Customer measure - Provides input that is related to an individual customer's behavior with breakdown by dimensions. For example, measuring the total number of visits that each of your customers made for each channel or each customer's total sales each day.

Business measure - Tracks items that are related to your business's performance and health. They might include items such as average sales per customer and monthly active users (MAU).

After the measures that you want to track are defined, they provide multiple benefits:

Displaying business measures on your organization's home page.

Viewing customer-specific measures as part of the customer card.

Using measures as criteria for defining customer segments with the Segment builder page.

Segments

Customer Insights segmentation capability enables you to group your customers based on demographic, transactional, or behavioral attributes. You can use segmentation to target promotional campaigns, sales activities, and customer support actions to achieve your business goals.

You can define complex filters around the Customer Profile table and its graph of related tables. Each segment, after processing, displays a set of customer table records that you can export and act on.

There are two types of segments:

Static: A segment that is processed only once---either upon the creation or update of any of its filters. These segments are especially useful when properties don't change over time or when they're only used once. Example use case: Customers who attended an expo event.

Dynamic: A segment that is processed according to a recurring schedule. These segments are especially useful when customers' attributes change over time. For example, customers who bought products worth more than $500 in the last three months. Dynamic segments refresh every 12 hours.

Customer Insights - Data helps you discover interesting segments of your customers with the help of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model. This machine learning powered feature can suggest segments based on measures or customer attributes. It can help improve your overall KPIs and help you to better understand the influence of attributes in context of other attributes.

For example, you can use segment suggestions to identify if customers in specific segments have a favorite time of day they like to engage. With Segment suggestions, you can identify which customers prefer a specific time of day and have the system help you create segments based on that data. Customer Insights - Data lets you configure suggested segment capabilities based on either measures or activities.

Predictions

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data comes with various options that leverage AI and machine learning to predict data. Predictions offer capabilities to create better customer experiences, improve business capabilities, and revenue streams. We strongly recommend you balance the value of your prediction against the impact it has and biases that might be introduced in an ethical manner.

The easiest way to start with predicting data is to leverage predefined models. They only require certain data and structure to generate insights quickly.

The following models are available:

Customer lifetime value: Predicts the potential revenue of a customer throughout the entire interaction with a business. See: Predict Customer lifetime value.

Product recommendation: Suggests sets of predictive product recommendations based on purchase behavior and customers with similar purchase patterns. See: Predict product recommendations.

Subscription churn: Predicts whether a customer is at risk for no longer using your company’s subscription products or services. See: Predict subscription churn.

Customer Sentiment analysis: Analyze sentiment of customer feedback and identify business aspects that are frequently mentioned. See: Analyze sentiment in customer feedback.

Typically, when people think about a Customer Data Platform (CDP), they consider its ability to help them create a 360-degree view of their customers across disparate data systems. While that capability is an important part of a Customer Data Platform, it's not necessarily the most important part.

Most important is what a CDP platform allows you to do with the data after you ingest it, unify it, and build insights around it. If your CDP predicts that a customer might stop doing business with you, act based on that information. Your CDP doesn't implement the actions you plan to take, such as sending coupons or having a sales representative reach out. Other applications complete those actions. The coupons that you send might be part of a customer journey that you implement in your preferred marketing application. Likely, your sales staff engages with customers by using some type of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application. A good CDP makes it easier for your organization to use that data in the applications that it uses every day.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Data makes it easy to take the data you have in the application and use it across your entire organization.

It's important to note that most users in your organization don't work directly in Customer Insights – Data. They work with the data collected by Customer Insights – Data. For example, your marketing person, who is responsible for running your LinkedIn advertising campaigns, typically isn't creating the measures, and segments in Customer Insights – Data. They will, however, use segments created in Customer Insights - Data in the campaigns they run through LinkedIn. This is accomplished by exporting data from Customer Insights – Data into the different applications where it is consumed.

Two main types of exports are:

Data-out - Export any type of entity that's available in Customer Insights. The entities that you select for export are exported with all data fields, metadata, schemas, and mapping details.

Segment - Export segment entities from Customer Insights - Data. Segments represent a list of customer profiles. When you're setting up the export, select the included data fields, depending on the target system that you plan to export data to.

Another area where you can use Customer Insights – Data is by interaction with common Microsoft Power Platform components. Once configured, you can use Customer Insights – Data to enhance the following applications:

Model-driven applications – Customer Insights – data can ingest data from model-driven applications such as Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Additionally, insights that are captured in the application can be surfaced directly on customer records in model-driven apps.

Power Apps - Apps that are created in Power Apps can be connected to Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data as a data source. This capability lets you use data from the unified customer profile and data from other applications simultaneously.

Power Automate - With Power Automate, you can run actions in other line-of-business applications based on data that is surfaced from Customer Insights - Data or on actions triggered in applications that are connected to Customer Insights - Data.

Power BI - The Customer Insights - Data Power BI connector enables you to use the unified customer profile within Microsoft Power BI to further analyze and uncover insight.

The following example is what a real-world scenario might look like.

Contoso Coffee sells premium-quality coffee and coffee machines through their retail stores, high-end food resellers, and their website.

Contoso plans to further expand their offerings with Contoso Cafés and a new Connected Coffee Machine, which can trigger refill orders and alert Contoso service about any issues. This new offering helps the company build direct relationships with their customers and learn more about how customers consume their products.

Business objective

Contoso's current business model doesn't provide them with a direct relationship with their customers. For this reason, they're unable to deliver personalized customer experiences. Contoso wants to own and build a meaningful, direct relationship with all consumers to deliver an exceptional, personalized customer experience through relevant communications, personalized recommendations, and services.

Contoso ingested all their data into a unified customer profile that provides them with all relevant data about their customers. They want to take the data that they now have and use it throughout their entire operation.

The company identified three main areas to focus on:

Making Customer Insights data (such as activities, measures, and customer profile information) available to staff while they're working in Dynamics 365 Sales or Customer Service.

Creating a "greeter app" that assists their retail staff in delivering more personalized customer experiences and provides recommendations based on historical data.

Gaining a deeper understanding of their business by uncovering insights for different functions of their business.

The following sections examine each one of their objectives to determine how it can be accomplished.

Surface Customer Insights - Data in model-driven applications

With the Customer Insights - Data Customer Card add-in that is available in AppSource, data that Customer Insights - Data captures can be surfaced on each contact record in Contoso's Dynamics 365 Sales or Service applications. When employees open a customer record, they can gain deeper insights through three Customer Insights - Data components:

Customer Insights - Data Timeline - Activities that represent purchases that customers made on the company's website or while at retail stores could be displayed in the Customer Insights - Data Timeline control on the card in the application.

KPI - Employees have access to important Customer Insights - Data measures such as Average Web Purchases, Lifetime Spend, and so on, directly from within their model-driven application.

Demographics - This configurable control can display important information from the unified customer profile.

Additionally, data from Dynamics 365 Sales or Customer Service can be ingested and used in the customer profile. For example, activities such as phone calls, meetings, or tasks could be ingested as needed.

Create a greeter app to deliver personalized service

With Power Apps, Contoso could create a "greeter" application and connect it directly to the unified customer profile in Customer Insights - Data. From the application, greeters at retail stores can check in on the customer while they wait for a sales associate to assist them and have access to all the information in that customer's profile. After the customer is checked in and directed to a sales associate, the associate could be presented with the next step recommendations based on information that is captured in Dynamics 365.

The "greeter" application might resemble the preceding image and would:

Use Customer Insights - Data as its primary data source.

Use Power Automate to:

Create a check-in activity in Dynamics 365.

Check-in activity data would be populated from Customer Profile information that is surfaced in the Power App.

Create a product recommendation card from Dynamics 365 Sales Insights.

This card could provide product recommendations or next steps.

Help the greeter present the recommendations to the associate in the Power App.
Uncover insights with Power BI

The Customer Insights - Data Power BI connector would connect to Audience Insights as a data source. Rich Power BI visualizations could be created and used to provide more insights.

As mentioned previously, the primary purpose of Customer Insights – data is to provide customers with personalized experiences. We want to make sure that any product recommendations, suggestions, etc. are based on who the customer is and their activities. Understanding your customers’ profiles and preferences is essential to driving these personalized experiences.

Customer Insights – Data uses generative AI capabilities to let you ask questions in natural language to quickly generate insights about your customers. This enables end users such as marketers, sellers, and service agents to get insights to better understand and serve customers easily without the support of IT teams or other tools. For example, let’s say that you’d like to run a campaign targeted at improving customer loyalty. You can ask Copilot "How many customers aren't members of the loyalty program but spent over $1,000 in the last six months?" You can then use this information to create a targeted segment and run an email campaign to boost loyalty program membership.

Another way that Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data can help you achieve your goals, is by answering questions about the application and its features. Think of it as on the fly end user training. Users can ask questions in natural language about capabilities and Copilot provides answers. Copilot uses official product documentation, troubleshooting guides, and blogs from the Microsoft team to provide answers.

Create segments

Segments are a major part of Customer Insights – Data. Not only can they be used to identify targets for marketing in other programs, but they can also be used to better understand your customer base. Historically, segments were created manually. With Copilot, you can simply describe the details of the segment you want to create using everyday words. Consider this simple segment: All customers that live in Seattle, Washington. You can also create segments based on existing measures: All customers that have a lifetime value of at least $500 and purchased an item within the past 30 days.

Dynamics 365 Sales provides a wide and powerful array of tools to help you take control of the entire sales process. Dynamics 365 Sales automates common tasks, delivers insights, and provides personalized recommendations based on how you work. You can easily identify which customers or sales lead to focus on and take the most appropriate actions based on your organization’s sales methodology. Dynamics 365 Sales provides many out-of-the-box features that support sales functions for organizations of all sizes. These features are designed in such a way that Sales can be easily configured to support an organization's specific or changing needs.

As you identify sales opportunities and qualify leads, Dynamics 365 Sales provides multiple tools that can be used to help with the lead qualification process.

Artificial intelligence tools: Tools, such as the business card scanner, allow you to quickly capture important information and input it into Dynamics 365 Sales or Power Apps while in the field. This functionality helps you quickly identify if there's a past relationship with this customer and determine what the next course of action should be.

Tailorable business process flows: Guides sellers through each stage of your organization’s sales lifecycle process. This process helps new sellers get started, ensuring they understand requirements at each stage and have the necessary data and tools. For all your sellers, this process is crucial. It ensures they know what’s needed at each stage and equips them to execute effectively.

Assistant: It surfaces important information relevant to your current tasks. For instance, it provides reminders about upcoming activities related to a sales lead. Additionally, it notifies you when customers take actions that might impact a potential deal.

Timeline: Surfaces any related communication directly on the records form. This display allows you to easily see all relevant communication from a single point. In addition, you can quickly generate communication such as phone calls, emails, and appointments, and interact with team members directly from the prospects record.

In addition to lead and opportunity management capabilities, Dynamics 365 Sales makes it easy to generate and deliver quotes to customers, as well as turn those quotes into sales orders and invoices. Dynamics 365 Sales can act as a standalone sales order processing solution. Sales can also be integrated with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications, such as Dynamics 365 ERP applications.

Dynamics 365 Sales makes winning deals easier by providing multiple sales delivery and collaboration tools such as:

Embedded Office 365 Tools: With embedded tools like Microsoft Excel and Word, you can use tools that you use every day to help build details, analyze deal details, and communicate with customers.

Microsoft Teams Integration: Engage Subject Matter Experts (SME) and collaborate with colleagues across business functions and geographies. Access Dynamics 365 data directly within a Team workspace to use Teams’ collaboration abilities.

Product Catalog: The dedicated product catalog can function stand-alone or be integrated with ERP applications, such as Dynamics 365 ERP applications. Using this catalog, you can quickly build sales quotes by adding products directly from it. Automated pricing options can update pricing details automatically.

Customized Pricing and Discounting: With multiple price lists, you can attach the most appropriate pricing based on who the customer is, current promotions, or specific sales scenario.

Product Families: Product families extend the product catalog functionality even more by providing a central area to define common properties such as sizing and coloring options, for all products in a family. Products can be linked together to provide greater support in common sales scenarios such as cross selling, product substitution, or upselling.

Power Platform: Execute business processes and speed up daily activities such as approval processes across line of business applications with automation powered by Microsoft Power Automate. This provides you with a richer overall experience and simplified execution of business tasks, by embedding automation of these items directly into Dynamics 365 forms.

Copilot: Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales helps sellers be more productive by using AI to provide suggestions, help research records, and streamline daily activities such as customer communication.

SharePoint & OneDrive Integration: Use the document storage and versioning capabilities of SharePoint and OneDrive to help with document collaboration. This lets you easily see who is working on documents, and what changes are being made. It also provides you with deeper insights to see what documents customers are accessing when you use them to store shared attachments.

Quote Management: Easily generate quotes directly from details stored in a sales opportunity. You can manage the entire sales negotiation process with easy quote revisions and quote delivery using familiar formats, such as Microsoft Word documents or PDFs.

Sales Orders: Sales orders can be created directly from Quotes when deals move forward. With Sales automation, related supply chain items can be opened or closed as the attached quote record is also closed.

Invoices: Invoices can be created from fulfilled sales orders, and the status of the invoice is tracked as the customer pays the invoice.

Now that we introduced you to Dynamics 365 Sales, let’s examine how it can be used to support sales organizations.

The goal of any sales organization is to identify prospects and turn them into revenue. For example, how do you take someone you met at an event and turn them into a customer? This process is referred to as a sales lifecycle.

A typical sales lifecycle might resemble the following image:

To help in sales lifecycle management, many organizations use processes that guide sellers throughout the entire sales lifecycle. A sales process ensures that everyone is following the appropriate procedures.

The image shows an example of what a sales lifecycle might look like from beginning to end:

As you can see in the image, different sales record types correspond to different stages in the sales process.

Qualify: A potential lead is identified and qualified.

Develop: An opportunity is created. Other details such as the products and services they're interested in, estimated revenue, and timelines are added to the opportunity.

Propose: A quote is added to the opportunity and formally presented to the customer.

Close: The customer agrees to the quote and an order is generated.

Fulfill: After the order is fulfilled, an invoice is generated to bill the customer.

Focused view

For anyone who works in sales, one thing that goes a long way is simplicity. How simple is it for me to perform the different tasks that I need to do each day? One way this can be done in Dynamics 365 Sales is with the Focused view. Focused view is a centralized place to view all your open records that have activities that are due or pending. This means that you do not need to navigate through multiple screens. Focused View can be used with Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities.

Another nice feature of the focused view is that if you open and then close it within the same view, the application will remember to open the grid in the same view when you access it the next time. For example, if you open the Account entity grid in the focused view and then close it, the next time you open the Account entity grid, it will open in the focused view.

The image below shows an example of working with Leads with the focused view.

As you can see, Dynamics 365 Sales is a valuable tool that assists organizations with managing their sales lifecycle. In most organizations, this lifecycle begins with leads. Let’s examine how Dynamics 365 Sales helps sellers create, manage, and qualify sales leads.

Describe leads and the process for qualifying leads
12 minutes

For most organizations, their sales process begins with leads. The goal of a lead is to determine the viability of them becoming a customer. This process is referred to as lead qualification. During qualification, information about the lead is gathered, the lead is contacted, and a decision is made about if you should move forward. For example, a potential customer reaches out to Contoso Coffee through their website to request more information about Contoso’s newest Internet of Things (IoT) related coffee machine. Initially, the Contoso teams don't really know if this person is a viable customer. Only after a salesperson reaches out and engages with the individual can it be determined if their needs align with what your organization can deliver.

Dynamics 365 Sales provides multiple ways to capture leads such as creating them manually, converting activities such as emails, or through a bulk import into the application. For example, Contoso Coffee purchases lists of leads based on the specific customer profile they want to target. Those lists are easily imported into the application.

After a lead is created, the seller will focus their attention on qualifying the lead. The qualification process might include placing phone calls, researching the customer, and engaging with stakeholders throughout the process. It's important that sellers and managers can easily capture and access this information. Dynamics 365 Sales provides several key pieces of information available that can be used to assist sellers during the qualification process.

These items include:

Sequences: Sequences help sales managers enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for sellers to follow during their day. Managers can connect sequences to leads and opportunities that appear in a seller's work queue. The sequences help sellers prioritize activities so they chain focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.

Timeline: Displays related lead activities. All activities are displayed in chronological order. These activities could include phone calls made or received, appointments with the lead, internal posts about the record made by colleagues, or notes that were added about the record.

For example, all appointments that the account executive had with the client would be listed. They can open each appointment to gather additional information from that meeting.

Assistant: Provides reminders or notifications about items related to the lead.

For example, the assistant might offer a reminder about an upcoming appointment related to the lead. Appointment details can be viewed by opening the record directly from the lead.

Stakeholders: Identifies individuals that might have a personal stake or be involved in the decision-making process. These individuals are typically contact records that are noted on the record.

For example, a stakeholder might be a lawyer the organization uses, a project lead, or board members that could be involved in the decision-making process.

Competitors: Identifies any other vendors that could potentially be competing for a customer’s business.

Business Process Flows: Represent guided processes that are used to guide account executives through the entire sales lifecycle.

Depending on the type of lead or company procedures, a lead might have multiple business processes available that can be switched on depending on specific details in the lead. These details could include the lead source, estimated budget, purchase timeframe, or other business factors.

After the seller completes the process of determining the viability of a potential lead, it can either be qualified or disqualified.

Qualified: Indicates the organization considers them to be a viable potential sale and is ready to move to the next phase in the sales process.

Disqualified: Indicates that you no longer pursue them as a customer.

Let’s look at how these features might be used to qualify or disqualify a newly identified lead:

Having leads assigned to them from marketing isn't the only way that a salesperson gets leads. Many times, they identify them at a product showcase or trade show. The salesperson meets a potential customer while working at a recent trade show. The customer expressed the need to update the machines they use at their coffee bar. They exchange business cards, and the salesperson enters the lead into the application. Dynamics 365 Sales launches the Lead to Opportunity sales process. The process begins in the Qualify stage since that is what we are trying to do.

The salesperson uses internet searches and social networking websites to gather general information related the lead as part of the qualification process. This information includes industry, number of employees, and annual revenue. The salesperson enters it to the lead record.

Optional integration features with applications like LinkedIn Sales Navigator could also help with the research process.

The salesperson calls the customer to talk about their current situation and how Contoso Coffee’s products could meet their potential needs. During this conversation, they might identify information such as project stakeholders, potential competitors, budget information, or the decision-making process.

Relevant information in the lead is updated accordingly.

Other notes from the call are captured in a phone call activity associated with the lead.

A post is added to the lead that asks coworkers if anyone has experience with this customer.

Coworker responses to the post are captured and displayed in the lead’s timeline.

The salesperson schedules a face-to-face meeting with key people in the organization.

The assistant reminds them before to the meeting.

The salesperson qualifies the lead.

The lead record is closed.

A new opportunity record is created.

The Lead to Opportunity sales process advances to the Develop phase.

Lead information is visible at any point, by selecting the Qualify phase.

Once a salesperson goes through the process of determining the viability of a potential lead, the lead can either be qualified or disqualified. A qualified lead indicates that they're a viable potential sale and are ready to move to the next phase in the sales process.

Describe the Product catalog
5 minutes

A product catalog is a collection of products and services that an organization sells and provides to its customers. It includes pricing information. A typical product catalog includes a list of the products an organization sells, along with different pricing tiers (such as retail and wholesale) and quantity levels based on how the product is sold.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 includes a product catalog that lets organizations create a rich product classification system that supports the following actions:

Define a hierarchical structure of product families and products that have configurable properties (attributes). These attributes help you reduce the number of product stock keeping units (SKUs) that are required to maintain your product catalog.

Sell individual products, or group them into bundles and kits. A bundle or a kit is a collection of products sold as a single unit. Product bundling is useful for grouping products in such a way that customers benefit from the full line of products. It also lets you offer discounts on bundled products.

Define related products in the system. For example, these related products might be substitute, cross-sell, up-sell, or accessory products. The related products for a product are shown to sales agents as suggestions when they add the product to an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice.

Define multiple pricing and discounting models. You can also use custom pricing instead of the Dynamics 365 system pricing to calculate prices when you associate a product or bundle with an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice. Additionally, you can select whether to apply discounts for products at the per-unit level or the line level.

Specify if the price list should be automatically set for an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice, based on the user's sales territory.

Specify localized values for some product properties or attributes to make the product names and descriptions available in user-preferred languages.

Product catalog components

The Dynamics 365 product catalog consists of four components:

Unit groups: A unit group defines how a product is packaged for sale. Among other values, it defines the units of measure that the product or service is sold in. For example, an organization that sells gaming systems might sell them individually on a crate that includes 12 individual gaming systems. An organization that provides services to customers might sell their services in increments of hours, days, or weeks.

Products: A product represents the type of product that a company might keep in inventory, a product that's custom-built, or a service provided to a customer. For example, a beauty salon's product list might include different hair styling products and services like haircuts, hair coloring, and spa services.

Price lists: A price list is a set of prices that are charged for products under specific circumstances. For example, an organization might have multiple price lists to accommodate seasonal variations, specials, or the different markets that the organization sells to (like government, commercial, and education).

Discount lists: A discount list lets organizations offer products or services at different prices, depending on the quantity bought. For example, a small vendor that buys five TVs to sell in its store might pay 350.00 US dollars per TV. A large vendor that buys 500 TVs to sell in multiple locations might pay 300.00 US dollars per TV.

The Product Catalog is used throughout the Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications.

Sales: The Product Catalog can be used to build out Opportunity, Quote, Order, and Invoice line items. This feature ensures that all items are using your organization's standard pricing.

Field Service: In Field Service, the Product Catalog is used to define the products and services that are provided as part of work orders.

Customer Service: In Customer Service, the product catalog can be associated with Knowledge Articles to make searching for articles easier. Additionally, individual cases can be associated with specific products in the product catalog to create a more detailed service history.

Customer Insights – Journeys: Product from the product catalog can be used in Customer Journeys and as part of Marketing Collateral.

Project Operations: The product catalog can be used to build out Opportunity, Quote, Order, and Invoice line items. This ensures that all items are leveraging your organization's standard pricing.

Opportunities represent a potential sale. Unlike leads, opportunities provide more specific details such as potential revenue, timelines, and product or service details. For Contoso Coffee, opportunities might specify a specific roast a customer is interested in, or the type of machine along with the number of machines they're looking to purchase. Opportunities are an important part of the sales process because that is typically what the sales team spends most of its time and effort. Managing opportunities typically includes several customer interactions such as meetings with the customer, phone calls, or tasks. Often, how well the sales team manages their opportunities is the difference between a win and a loss.

Effectively managing opportunities can involve several tasks:

Assigning and sharing opportunities with the most appropriates individuals or teams.

Tracking product and service details for items the customer is interested in.

Providing the most appropriate literature to the customer.

Managing and tracking sales activities related to the opportunity.

Tracking stakeholders and competitors.

Moving opportunities through a sales process workflow.

The opportunity pipeline view makes it easy for sellers to work with their opportunities. The pipeline score chart shows all your opportunities in chronological order based on their estimated close date. Opportunities are color code based on their lead score and the circles are based on the size of the opportunity. The larger the circle, the larger the deal.

When opportunities are created, it's important to define as much information as possible about the current situation and what is needed to move forward. This information helps organizations better understand which sales process should be executed, based on the opportunity type, size, and timeline. It can also help the organization better understand what sales resources should be assigned to the record to provide them with the best chance of winning the deal.

Like leads, opportunities contain information that can be useful as the opportunity is being worked such as the Timeline, Assistant, Stakeholders, Competitors, and Business Process Flows. Additionally, opportunities define the products, services, and price list details for items that are included in the opportunity. In the image, we can see an example opportunity for Contoso Coffee. The opportunity includes two Café’ S-100 Semiautomatic espresso machines. Based on cost details provided in Dynamics 365 Sales, the estimated revenue for opportunity is automatically calculated based on the Contoso Coffee Price List.

This information helps not only to better forecast revenue, but it helps as the opportunity advances through the sales process.

As mentioned previously, sellers work out the specific details of a customer solution in opportunities. After the seller defines the details and the customer is ready for a formal proposal, the seller presents the customer with a quote. The quote defines pricing information and product quantities.

Quotes can be created manually or directly from an opportunity. Quotes created from opportunities include important details from the opportunity record, such as pricing information and any attached line items are automatically added. Individual product line items can be added and removed as needed.

When a quote is first created, it has a status of Draft. Draft quotes can be modified and have products added or removed. When the quote is ready to be presented to a customer, it needs to be activated. An activated quote is read-only. Once a quote is active, it's ready to be presented to the customer. Quotes can be generated as Microsoft Word or PDF documents.

Typically, the first version of a quote presented to the customer isn't the version they end up signing. It's common for a customer to request that items be removed, or quantities adjusted. For example, the quote initially included 10 security cameras, but the customer decides they want to start with five for now.

Active quotes in Dynamics 365 Sales can't be edited. Changes to quotes are done as revisions. When a quote is revised, the original version of the quote is closed and retained for historical purposes, and a new version is created with an updated revision number. This process ensures that all previous versions of the quote are accessible at any time. After the seller applies the necessary changes, the updated quote can be activated and be presented to the customer.

Once the customer signs off on a quote, it can be closed, and an order can be generated. When the seller closes the quote, the seller can elect to convert the quote to an order. Additionally, if the quote was generated from an opportunity, you can select to close the opportunity as well. It's important to note that after a quote is accepted, you won't be able to revise it.

Orders & Invoices

After the quote lifecycle, when the customer is ready to progress, they'll likely place an order. An order is a commitment from a customer to buy products or services. Most orders are created as a direct result of an accepted quote. There are times, however, when an order unrelated to a quote needs to be created.

When quotes are converted to orders, the contents of the quote are added to the order record, and the quote is closed. The products and items on the order can be edited as needed. If an order is created manually, you need to add all the necessary order information such as the potential customer, name, and price list information.

Products and pricing for an order can be updated as needed. Orders typically represent the last stage of a sales process. Organizations therefore need to ensure that the pricing information related to them is correct. Organizations can limit the products and pricing by locking and unlocking pricing as needed. Locking pricing is used to ensure that only existing products with the current pricing model are used. When pricing is locked, it's not possible to overwrite the pricing information on the order. By unlocking pricing, you can overwrite any pricing field as needed.

Once the order is placed, it needs to be fulfilled. Fulfilling the order involves providing the services or products that the customer asked for in the order. Dynamics 365 Sales allows users to track when orders were fulfilled. Fulfillment can be marked as complete or partial.

After an order is fulfilled, you can create an invoice. Invoices are requests for payment from a business to its customers. Invoices can be, but aren't required to be, related to orders. The most common way for an invoice to be generated in the system is to be created directly from an order. When the invoice is created, all the products that were associated with the order are automatically added to the invoice. Other products or services can be added or removed from the order after it has been created.

After an invoice was created, individual line items can be added and edited as needed as with orders. Also, just like orders, pricing information can be locked and unlocked as needed.

Once the customer pays the invoice, you can mark the invoice as paid. When you mark an invoice as paid, you can select one of two options:

Completed: The customer pays the invoice in full.

Partial: The customer only pays a portion of the invoice.

Describe Dynamics 365 Sales business process flows
11 minutes

Many organizations have processes they use during a sales lifecycle to ensure they have the best opportunity to close a deal. During lead qualification, for example, sales representatives perform tasks to determine if an opportunity is viable. The salespeople identify how company purchases items, capture the purchasing timeframe, and capture other relevant information. Once the lead is qualified, they might identify other items such as the revenue, or whether a credit check is required.

A Business Process Flow (BPF) in Dynamics 365 provides a guide for how to get work done. They provide a streamlined user experience that guides people through specific processes defined by their organization. For example, Contoso Coffee uses business process flows to guide sellers through the process of qualifying a lead, managing the opportunity, preparing the quote, and generating an order.

A business process flow consists of the primary elements of stages and steps. From a sales perspective, a BPF stage might represent a stage in the sales process such as qualifying a customer or proposing a solution. The stage, in turn, contains steps. These steps are fields that can be filled in as they're completed, such as checking a box when you identified the decision maker.

Out of the box, Dynamics 365 Sales comes with two built-in business process flows targeted at sales.

Lead to Opportunity Sales Process: Sales process consisting of four stages Qualify > Develop > Propose > Close that begins on a lead record and spans through the closing of an opportunity.

Opportunity Sales Process: Like the Lead to Opportunity process, it consists of the same four stages. It begins, however, when an opportunity is created.

In the image, we can see an example of the Lead to Opportunity process being applied to a newly created lead for Contoso Coffee.

During the Qualify stage, you're presented with steps for capturing items such as the Purchase Process, Estimated Budget, Purchase Timeframe and more. Once ready, you can easily advance to the Develop stage, before moving on to the propose and close stages. The business process flow ensures that all salespeople are following the same repeatable processes. This adherence to a standard process allows salespeople to maximize the chances of winning deals and ensuring that nothing is missed.

Clickthrough demo: Business process flow

In this clickthrough demonstration, you're guided through a typical lead management process. This process includes creating a new lead in the application and using Dynamics 365 Sales functionality to move it through the qualification process.

Dynamics 365 Sales Business Process Flow

As you saw, Dynamics 365 Sales makes it easy for individuals to capture and qualify leads. Leads can be easily created in multiple ways to accommodate different selling models. After creation, business process flows help sellers in capturing essential information and following steps to qualify leads that meet their organization’s criteria.

Putting it all together

Now that we examined these features individually, let’s look at how the combination of all the features we discussed is used to move a salesperson's qualified lead to an opportunity.

Qualify: The salesperson qualifies the lead using the lead qualification process outlined earlier.

Develop: The record automatically advanced to the Develop stage when the lead was converted to an opportunity.

The salesperson completes any additional information that is needed for the opportunity such as estimated close date, customer need, and budgetary information.

Stakeholders are added that represent project team members, advisory board members, legal counsel, etc.

Competitors are added that we're competing against on the opportunity.

Products and pricing information is defined.

The opportunity is set to use system calculated pricing, and the retail price list is defined.

Each line item is included, and pricing information is defined.

A meeting is scheduled with the customer for one week from today.

The assistant reminds the account executive of the appointment.

During the meeting, the customer asks for a formal proposal on the solution.

The salesperson advances the opportunity to the Propose stage.

Propose: A formal quote is generated and delivered to the customer.

The internal sales resources needed on the opportunity are defined.

Sales team members are added.

Optionally, access teams could be used to provide record access to defined members.

A quote is added to the opportunity that includes all the products defined on the opportunity.

A meeting is scheduled with the customer to formally present the quote to them.

The team prepares a final presentation attached to the opportunity.

Optionally, integration with SharePoint or OneDrive can be used to store related documents.

The quote is activated and presented to the customer during the meeting.

Notes on the meeting are updated.

The customer accepts the quote.

The salesperson advances the Opportunity to the Close stage.

Close: The necessary tasks needed to close the opportunity are completed.

The customer receives and signs the final proposal.

The quote is converted to an order and closed.

The opportunity is closed.

Opportunities can be closed in multiple ways. They can be closed automatically when an associated quote is closed, or when an order is created from a quote. The other way is to close the opportunity manually.

When working with customers, it’s important that sellers always have the best information and most current information available to them. Additionally, they need the details related to who they should target and having accessible tools that help ensure they're always moving customer deals forward.

The Sales Accelerator in Dynamics 365 provides sellers with a tailored experience that helps them minimize the time they spend identifying which customer they should reach out to next. It gathers information from multiple sources and presents it in a way that lets sellers focus on how to best approach their customers.

In Dynamics 365 Sales, the Sales Accelerator helps a sales team understand customers' needs and respond in the following ways:

Engage with customers by using multiple channels within one workspace.

Minimize the time spent on searching for the next best customer to reach out to.

Gather information from multiple sources and let sellers focus on how to best approach their customers.

Sell smartly by:

building a strong and prioritized pipeline

offering context

surfacing automated recommendations throughout a sales sequence

One of the primary elements in the Sales Accelerator is the work list. The worklist provides sellers with activities they need to focus on and AI-based recommendations that could favorably affect the sales outcomes. Work list items are presented in a prioritized view aggregated by record. This holistic view of the tasks that sellers should focus on helps to improve customer engagement.

Another key component of the Sales Accelerator is sequences. Sequences help enforce seller best practices through sets of consecutive activities they follow during their day. Organizations can connect sequences to lead and opportunity records. For example, an organization might create a lead nurturing sequence that is assigned to different leads. The sequence might include multiple activities such as phone calls, activities, and meetings that the seller needs to follow as the lead moves through the sale lifecycle.

Since it's common for a record to fall under multiple categories, a single record can have multiple sequences that run in parallel of each other. This ensures that all the tasks that need to be done for that record are being done, regardless of the sequence being used.

You can learn more about sequences in Dynamics 365 here: Sequences

Once your sequences are being used, use sequence analytics to monitor a sequence’s overall progress and effectiveness. This helps organizations to:

Monitor the inflow and outflow of every step to identify ways to improve the steps for better sales outcomes and sequence performance.

Drill down details to help identify changes to drive efficiency and effectiveness.

Identify deviations from the process to find areas to focus on.

Short Message Service (SMS) messages

More business communication is happening through SMS messages. SMS messages provide a simple and effective way to communicate with customers. In Dynamics 365 Sales, you can enable the ability to send and receive SMS messages from customers through the text message feature. Sellers are able to interact with customers by SMS. They can also refer to past communication in context without leaving the application or losing their view of customers' details.

Copilot is an AI assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales that helps sales teams be more productive and efficient in their daily work. Dynamics 365 Sales users can use the chat interface to interact with and obtain information. They can get a quick summary of their opportunity and lead records, catch up on recent changes to their records, prepare for meetings, and read the latest news about their accounts.

The following Copilot capabilities are available in Dynamics 365 Sales:

Record summarization: Record summarization examines all the details related to a lead or opportunity and provides sellers with a quick summary. Having Copilot complete those tasks reduces the amount of time that a seller needs to prep when getting ready to interact with a lead or opportunity.

Recent changes: Summarizes any changes that were made to your lead, opportunity, and account records.

Meeting preparation: Helps you prepare for your upcoming meetings effortlessly, summarizing relevant information from the opportunity or lead records that are associated with the meeting.

Compose emails: Helps you compose professional-looking emails, summarize email conversations to add to your customer notes, and gives you reminders to follow up on unanswered emails.

Product content recommendations: Provides contextual content recommendations based on the products that are included on an Opportunity. This data may come from different data sources such as SharePoint.

Get answers from sales documents: Looks up relevant sales information across all SharePoint files that the signed-in user has access to.

Sales Qualification agent

The process of qualifying leads is critical to a sellers success. Effectively qualifying leads takes time. You must do significant research, and you need to comb through many different sources. The Sales Qualification agent in Dynamics 365 Sales is an AI assistant that automates the manual aspects of lead qualification. While it doesn't replace your judgment or decision-making process, it’s designed to help you qualify leads faster and more effectively.

The agent autonomously researches leads to determine if they're a good fit for further engagement. It provides you with detailed insights about each lead. These insights include:

Background: Allows you to better understand the lead's role, company, and industry.

Insights: Helps determine whether you should engage with the lead or not. Learn more about the lead's recent activities, such as their recent opportunities, colleagues who worked with the leads, and why this lead matches your ideal customer profile.

News: Keeps you updated with the latest news about the lead's company and industry.

Once active, the lead qualification agent displays on lead records that meet the agent’s selection criteria. A banner displays that includes the agent’s recommendation and two action buttons:

Review email: Opens a draft outreach email that the agent generated for you based on its insights. The email is ready to send, but you should review it and make any required changes before you send it.

More insights: This opens the Lead insights page, which offers a 360-degree view of the lead and includes the date the agent last updated its research data.

The Lead Insights page includes the following information.

Key insights: This section summarizes key insights about the lead, including why it is or isn't a good fit for your business based on the ideal customer profile.

If your company uses Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, key insights also include recent marketing activities, such as email opens, link clicks, event registrations and attendance, and form submissions.

Email validation: The agent performs two checks on a lead's primary email address: whether it's a valid address and whether it's a work or personal address. These checks help make sure that the lead's email address is active, deliverable, and relevant for business communications.

Email validity: The agent looks for email validation errors to make sure that the address is properly formatted and deliverable. If the email address is invalid, the agent prompts you to enter a valid address.

Email type: The agent determines whether the address is a work or personal email address and labels it in the interface.

About lead: This section includes a summary of key fields, opportunities that are open with the lead, and your colleagues who interacted with the lead in emails or meetings.

About account: This section includes a summary of key details about the account based on insights that the agent pulls from the web.

Business overview: Insights on the company's industry, size, products and services, and mission statement.

Finances: Insights on the company's financial health and key financial metrics.

Account news: Insights from relevant news articles, such as product launches, leadership changes, contracts or clients won, community involvement, awards, and recognition.

To understand your business’s health, and to make informed strategic business decisions, you need to be able to accurately forecast sales targets. Sales forecasts estimate how much your organization is expecting to sell within a specific period. Accurate sales forecasting is critical to the success of a business. Not only do they help you identify the potential revenue coming in, but they help companies drive all parts of their business. For example, Contoso Coffee’s CEO's need to foresee demand for every product they sell such as coffee and espresso machines to undertake strategic business transformations. Their COO's need to understand the scope of the business to allocate sales resources efficiently. Contoso’s CFO's need visibility into upcoming cash flows to craft financial plans for business growth as they begin to expand into new markets.

With Dynamics 365 Sales forecasting, organizations are empowered to create and manage bottom-up sales forecast processes directly in Dynamics 365 Sales.

Accurate forecasting helps everyone on the team:

Sellers: Sellers can manage their time and sales pipeline more effectively, by making it easy to identify which deals they should be focusing on need to close to meet quotas.

Sales managers and leaders: Sales leaders can plan sales execution strategies and meet sales forecasts more confidently, with greater flexibility, and a clearer view into bottom-up projections. At the same time, they gain a deeper understanding of those opportunities that impact the business.

Sales enablement managers: Managers can benefit from greater flexibility to offer more granular and meaningful guidance that accurately reflects sales execution.

Organizational leaders: Organizational leaders can use projected estimates to change product strategy or convey updated projections to investors.

To help organizations get started quickly with forecasting, Dynamics 365 Sales includes an out-of-the-box forecast that is available to all users. The forecast is based on the sales team hierarchy. This means that the forecast reflects the structure of the sales team, providing insights that align with the organization's structure. It uses the opportunity table as the rollup entity and is available for the current month.

As mentioned previously, organizations are prioritizing building deep relationships with customers as a selling technique. This is especially true in Business-to-Business (B2B) sales where the sales life cycle is longer. Good relationship sellers can prioritize the connection they have with their customers over all other aspects of the sale. By developing trust, adding business value, and spending time with prospects, they can offer the right solution that fits all their needs. This approach puts them in the best position to provide services for the long term.

Relationships are built by knowing who your customers are, understanding what is important to them, and through regular and appropriate communication with them. This all impacts how the customer feels about you and your relationship together. If you only engage with customers during equipment upgrades, you miss building a personal connection. That connection is essential for encouraging long-term loyalty. They're likely to just go with the vendor that is the cheapest, or the vendor that is taking the time to build that personal connection with them. In the latter scenario, not only do you lose their current business, but you're also likely losing future business from them as well.

Dynamics 365 Sales Insights is a suite of features that continuously analyze the vast collection of customer interaction data already stored in your Dynamics 365 Sales and Office 365 databases. Sales Insights examines how often you're engaging your customers, how often they're engaging you, upcoming sales activities, and the contents of communication. This helps you better understand your business relationships, evaluate your activities in relation to previous successes, and choose the best path forward. For example, by analyzing this kind of information, Sales Insights can detect when you're no longer communicating as often with a customer compared to the past. You're notified that the relationship is slipping and are given assistance with how to communicate with them.

When you reach out, information from past communication can be used to help initiate the conversation and make it more personable. For example, if the customer mentioned in a past email about a vacation they took, that information is made available to you to help facilitate and engage with them.

Sales Insights enables you to build stronger relationships with your customers, take actions based on insights, and close opportunities faster. Dynamics 365 Sales Insights provides different levels of features. Some are included automatically when you purchase Dynamics 365 Sales, and others are available when you purchase Dynamics 365 Sales Insights in addition to your Dynamics 365 Sales application.

Let’s examine which features are available at the different levels:

Dynamics 365 Sales Insights features included in Dynamics 365 Sales

Assistant: Combines and analyzes the data at its disposal to generate action cards. These cards help to ensure that you aren't missing deadlines, remind you of appointments, and notify you of important information related to your customers. Each card includes a message summarizing what the card is about, and a set of links for acting. Cards are sorted by priority and filtered based on your current context.

Auto capture: Looks for messages sent to or from relevant email addresses and presents them inside Dynamics 365 Sales. Staff members can examine the messages surfaced in the application and determine if they're important and should be tracked in the application. Once they're tracked, they're visible to other Dynamics 365 users.

Email engagement: Helps create more effective email messages and learn how your contacts are interacting with them. As emails are opened, replied to, and forwarded on by customers, email engagement tracks those activities and reports back information. It can also remind sales staff of actions to take based on customers viewing or not viewing emails.

Sales accelerator: Basic Sales Accelerator functionality provides sellers with basic access to workspace functionality to manage their daily activities. Sequences provide a series of sequential tasks to sellers to help support them as they do things such as nurture sales leads and opportunities. Each organization can have up to 1,500 sequence instances a month with Dynamics 365 Sales. Unlimited sequence instances are available with your upgrade to Sales Insights Premium.

Dynamics 365 Sales Insights Premium features that require Dynamics 365 Sales Insights licensing

With the advanced functionality, you receive all of the above mentioned free Sales Insights features along with the following features:

Assistant with Studio (full capabilities): In addition to the base assistant capabilities, you receive the ability to create and display custom insight cards using the Studio. The Studio helps you to create custom insight cards through Power Automate. After you create the cards, you can configure prioritization and who can see the cards.

Relationship analytics: Gathers information from Dynamics 365 Sales for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and activity histories and displays it in a graphical representation.

Predictive lead scoring: Helps you to focus on revenue generation efforts by providing a score to prioritize efforts on quality leads.

Predictive opportunity scoring: Helps you to focus on revenue generation efforts by providing a score to prioritize efforts on quality opportunities.

Notes analysis: Monitors notes that you enter regarding a recent meeting or discussion with your customer to provide intelligent suggestions.

Who knows whom: Provides details such as names and email addresses of your colleagues who know a lead that you're going to interact with.

Premium forecasting: Premium forecasting helps sellers and managers improve their forecast accuracy by providing forecast projections based on data. To achieve this, premium forecasting uses AI-driven models that look at historical data and the sales pipeline to predict future revenue outcomes.

Sales Accelerator: The Sales Accelerator in Dynamics 365 provides a tailored experience for sellers by minimizing the time they spend on their search for the best next customer to reach out to. The Sales accelerator gathers information from multiple sources and allows sellers to focus on how to best approach their customers. Sellers benefit from building a strong, prioritized pipeline and offering context. Automated recommendations speed up the sales process.

A key part in building relationships today is being able to effectively use social media as a sales tool. This is where you use social media to find, connect with, and nurture sales prospects. This approach is typically referred to as social selling. With social media so engrained in our daily lives, it's the modern way to build meaningful relationships with potential customers early so that it's your company who they think of when they're ready to buy. For many people, it replaced the process of cold calling where you call as many people as possible to attempt to get a meeting.

One of the best ways to identify good prospects and build relationships with them is through LinkedIn. LinkedIn is an online platform that connects business professionals. Your LinkedIn profile summarizes your professional experience to your current connections, current and future employers, and recruiters. LinkedIn can also act as a powerful sales tool. LinkedIn Sales Insights is LinkedIn designed for sales professionals. It provides searching capabilities, deeper visibility into extended networks, and personalized algorithms that help you reach the right decision maker. For example, with Linked Sales Insights you could easily search for any healthcare CEOs in your geographic region that has been in their current role for less than a year. By specifying less than a year, you're likely identifying people that are new to their role in the organization and don't have already established relationships with competitors. Once you identify those individuals, you can use the sales lifecycle management capabilities of Dynamics 365 Sales to help convert them into revenue and build a long-term relationship with them.

Microsoft Relationship Sales brings together both LinkedIn Sales Insights and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales to empower sellers to drive that more personalized and meaningful engagement with buyers. By integrating Dynamics 365 Sales with LinkedIn Sales Insights and using your LinkedIn network, you identify potential sales leads and gain avenues for introductions with prospects. This positions you as a subject matter expert that prospects want to engage with, helping build trust and strengthen relationships over time.

LinkedIn Sales Insights integration with Dynamics 365 Sales creates a seamless experience between LinkedIn Sales Insights and Dynamics 365, empowering sales reps to get insights on customers and recommendations directly from any Dynamics 365 record.

With LinkedIn Sales Insights integration, sellers can:

Get headline information, recent activities, news, and job change information when viewing the customer record in Dynamics 365.

Use icebreakers to identify commonalities between you and your prospects.

Ask for an introduction to the lead from anyone within their network or anyone in your organization who might be connected to the lead.

Get one-click access to LinkedIn InMail and increase your probability of reaching your buyer.

Have LinkedIn user images used as ​Contact images in Dynamics 365.

Surface LinkedIn Activities such as InMail activities in the Activity Timeline displayed in Dynamics 365.

LinkedIn Sales Insights controls are available and can be placed on Dynamics 365 Sales forms. There are two types of controls available.

LinkedIn Sales Insights Lead control: Shows information about a LinkedIn member profile. It contains the following sections, which you can choose to show or hide:

Top Card: Shows information about the person like name, headline, and more. Additionally, it provides capabilities to message or save the person as a lead in LinkedIn Sales Insights.

News (Icebreakers): Shows the person’s highlights, activities, conversation starters, and more.

Connections (Get Introduced): Shows the mutual connections and allows for a warm introduction to the person.

Related Leads: Shows potential LinkedIn Sales Insights leads who are like the target person and might represent the relevant stakeholders around them. On a sales scenario, this insight is crucial to identify the potential decision-makers for a deal.

LinkedIn Sales Insights Account control: Shows information about a LinkedIn company profile. It has four modules, which you can choose to show or hide:

Top Card: Shows information about the company like company name, industry, location, and more. Additionally, provides capabilities to view the related account and save it in LinkedIn Sales Insights.

News: Shows the latest news of this company.

Connections: Shows relevant connections for this company that can establish a first contact.

Recommended Leads: Shows the recommended potential leads in this company that might be opportunities open for the next deal.

By combining both items into a single place, you can gain more insight into a prospect and engage with them through personalized content. When combined with other Dynamics 365 components, such as Sales Insights, you gain the ability to observe a potential buyer’s interests. This insight is derived from analyzing the content they share on LinkedIn and their active participation in discussions. By using this integration, you can discern what topics and areas engage the potential buyer. This knowledge helps tailor your approach and build more effective connections.

Now that we saw how LinkedIn is used to identify and engage with prospects, let’s how Dynamics 365 Sales Insights can help build long lasting relationships with those customers.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps you serve your customers better by equipping you with what you need to be successful. It provides tools to help manage caseloads, generate service-related activities, and find the best resolution to a customer’s problem. It provides traditional case management functionality, or when paired with other Dynamics 365 Service applications, it provides a foundation to build a complete omnichannel solution for your customers.

In today’s world, agents must have a total understanding of a customer when they request support. For example, some customers may be entitled to different levels of service than others. The response time promised to a customer may vary based on their identity and purchase history. They may also have a specified number of cases they can open for the products they’ve purchased. Failure to meet those promises can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and customer retention.

By using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, you can:

Enter and track customer issues by creating case records

Manage and log all related case interactions, such as phone calls and tasks

Provide a platform to share knowledge by applying the knowledge base

Create queues and route cases to the right channels

Manage issues for multiple customers at one time with multi session capabilities

Route issues to the most qualified agent through intelligent routing

Create and track service levels through Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Define service terms through entitlements

Manage performance and productivity through reports and dashboards

Create and schedule services

Provide agent guidance with agent scripts

Manage conversations across channels

There are many different scenarios where an organization might use Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

Contact Center: A contact center might utilize Dynamics 365 Customer Service or Dynamics 365 Contact Center for their contact center staff. As customers engage with the organization across different channels, items are routed to the best agent to work on the item based on the agent’s experience.

Service Center: A service center such as an automotive repair shop might use Dynamics 365 Customer Service for scheduling services provided to customers at dedicated service centers.

Knowledge Repository: A customer support center might use the knowledge management capabilities of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Customer Service helps create a knowledge repository that is accessible to agents while working to resolve customer issues.

The use cases mentioned represent a few possible scenarios where Dynamics 365 Customer Service might be used. Let’s look at an example of how Dynamics 365 Customer Service can be used to provide an end-to-end customer service solution.

As we can see from the image, we have a gold customer who has a support agreement with our organization that entitles them to open 15 cases with our organization during a predefined period.

The customer’s support agreement determines how they can open new cases. They can do so through multiple channels, including phone, mobile device, social media, or email. (In our example, the customer sent an email requesting support.)

Case creation rules examine the received email to identify those from whom it came. The email's content is also examined to create a case record for the customer in the application.

Routing rules examine criteria on the case to automatically route the case to the most appropriate queue once the case record is created. In this scenario, it routes the case to a dedicated queue for cases submitted by gold customers.

The customer, as a gold customer, is entitled to initial contact from an agent within 15 minutes of creating a case, as determined by a service level agreement in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

A support agent who has access to the gold queue, grabs the case from the queue to work on it and is now responsible for resolving the case.

Case resolution business process flow within the record provides guidance to the agent while they work through resolving the case.

The agent finds a knowledge article that contains a potential resolution to the case by using the organization's knowledge base. From within the case record, they can email the article directly to the customer and resolve the case.

The customer’s entitlement record, which stores their support agreement details, is updated to reflect that they now have 14 cases remaining on their entitlement.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service makes it easier for you to work on and manage caseloads. It also provides you with the same user experience regardless of the platform you're using, such as a phone, tablet, or PC.

Case management

Case Lifecycle Management uses multiple features you can use to help manage and resolve the case records assigned to you.

Session management: Session tabs allow agents to work with multiple customers simultaneously. This feature allows agents to increase their efficiency and switch between sessions as they're working with customers without losing conversation context or customer details.

Timeline: Displays related case activities. Time spent on case-related activities is recorded to determine how much time should be billed back to the customer.

For example, if an agent placed three phone calls to a customer, each lasting 15 minutes, they might bill back 45 minutes to the customer.

Related: Provides quick access to search the knowledge base directly from the case record. Data from the case record is used to populate the search criteria.

Once a knowledge article is identified, it can be emailed to the customer directly from the case and attached to the case record. This record can be helpful to agents in the future working on similar cases.

Entitlements and SLAs

As a support organization, you want to ensure you're meeting the needs of your customers and fulfilling the promises that you made to them. One way that organizations meet their customers' support expectations is by providing support agreements to their customers. A support agreement typically entitles a customer to a specified amount of support over a specified period. For example, Contoso Coffee might have a customer who is entitled to 10 hours of phone support over a six-month period. Or Contoso Coffee might be able to open 15 cases related to a specific product.

Another way that organizations can measure success is through response and resolution times. Based on factors such as who is reporting the issue or the issue type, they might promise different timeframes related to the item.

For example, a customer who has a support agreement with your organization might be promised a faster response time than someone who doesn't have a support contract. Dynamics 365 Customer Service helps organizations manage their service promises to customers through two mechanisms.

Service Level Agreements: Tracks and defines what should happen when a case is opened. SLAs determine the initial response time by a support engineer, or how long it takes to resolve the case.

Entitlements: Agreements that define the level and type of support to which a customer is entitled.

Service Level Agreements (SLA) help meet the desired service levels when providing support to customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Service SLAs allow you to track common Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as first response and resolution time for every case that is submitted.

The image demonstrates what a typical SLA might look like for different types of customers based on their promised level of service.

Entitlements define specific support details that were promised to a customer. They include specified coverage dates and specified number of cases, or length of time. For example, a customer might be entitled to place 35 phone calls to a help desk team. Another customer is entitled to a total of 100 hours of technical support over multiple channels of communication.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service entitlements can help to support these types of instances, and can be used to manage and enforce various scenarios including:

Management of warranty contracts

Service specific contracts

Incident-based support contracts

Time-based support contracts

Customers needing support can submit help requests in many ways. Historically the most common way was through a phone call. Support agents would create cases as they received calls from customers. Today, support requests can be submitted from almost anywhere. Cases can be created through a chat request on your website, a social channel, or automatically from an IoT device alert or event.

In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, cases can be created in multiple ways based on the needs of the organizations.

Manually: Support agents can create cases manually as they take incoming calls from customers. For example, a support agent might manually convert an incoming phone call activity they receive from a customer into a case.
‎‎
‎‎In many instances, cases might also be manually created directly from a customer record such as accounts and contacts.

Automatically: Record creation rules can be defined that create new case records automatically from different types of records in the application. For example, when a new email is received, a rule automatically creates a case record and populates the details of the case based on who sent the email.

Once in the system, it's important to ensure the most appropriate person is working on the case. Organizations handle cases differently, based on their unique circumstances. For example, organizations with small call volumes might not need to route cases because their staff can support all their different scenarios. Larger organizations, however, need to be able to automatically route cases based on different scenarios. For example, if a case is related to a specific product, they might want to route the case to an agent who is skilled in that product.

Dynamics 365 Customer Service uses queues to help with workload management. A queue is a holding container for cases. Organizations typically create multiple queues based on how they want to route cases. For example, you might create a queue that represents each of the different departments that handle cases.

Cases can be routed to queues in multiple ways. Agents can manually place cases into specific queues, or routing rules can be created to help automatically route items to queues. Dynamics 365 Customer Service includes two types of routing:

Basic: Typically used to route records such as cases, leads, emails, etc. to individuals, teams, or queues based on different defined rule criteria. The criteria used with the basic routing feature are typically basic and simple.

Advanced (Unified Routing): Provides more advanced routing capabilities that direct incoming work to the best suited queue and agent. Unified routing provides more advanced routing capabilities.

For example: A basic routing rule set might contain the following rule items:

Gold Route: Route any case with a service level of gold to the gold queue.

Silver Route: Route any case with a service level of silver to the silver queue.

Bronze Route: Route any case with a service level of bronze to the bronze queue.

Organizations can tailor their solution delivery process by manually and automatically creating and routing cases based on their specific needs.

The image shows a common example of using both case and queues in Dynamics 365:

A gold customer opens a new case by calling into support.

The case is routed to a gold queue.

Records in the gold queue are only visible to members of the gold queue.

An agent can pick one or more specific items to work on.

The item is placed into the agent’s personal queue.

Once the agent resolves the case, it's removed from their personal queue.

If the agent can't complete work on the specific queue item, they can release the item and it's placed back into the gold queue.

Now that we saw cases can be created and routed, let’s examine Dynamics 365’s knowledge management capabilities.

With Dynamics 365’s knowledge management capabilities, organizations can provide information to both their employees and customers by creating and managing knowledge articles that provide the information individuals are looking for. Knowledge articles help address any number of issues customers and employees encounter while using your organization's product or services. Knowledge articles might include solutions to common issues, product or feature documentation, answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), or product briefs. Dynamics 365 Customer Service lets organizations not only create knowledge articles, but format the article content, embed videos or images, and more.

The knowledge management capabilities of Dynamics 365 Customer Service organizations allow organizations to do the following tasks:

Create and design knowledge articles: Create rich well formatted knowledge articles and emails to send to customers that can include embedded videos, images, links, and more. For example, an article can include a link to a YouTube video that visually walks through the process defined in the article content.

Manage article life cycle: Out-of-the-box business process flows help to ensure that all knowledge content is current and meets necessary standards.

Manage article version history: As articles are updated, you can manage updates and work with previous versions without disrupting the live or published articles.

Translate articles: Provide multiple language translation versions of an article. For example, agents can send articles to customers in their preferred language if it's available.

Publish articles: Publish articles as soon as they're approved or schedule them to be published later. You can also set expiration dates on articles.

The image shows an example of how this process works in its entirety:

Customer Knowledge Management Agent

There is also an agent that assists with knowledge management. The Customer Knowledge Management Agent is an AI-powered tool in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service designed to autonomously turn cases and case-related conversations, emails, and notes into knowledge articles. The Customer Knowledge Management Agent helps extract knowledge from cases and manage customer knowledge in real time. After a case is closed, the agent analyzes case details, fills knowledge gaps, and ensures compliance.

The Customer Knowledge Management Agent can do the following:

Real-time knowledge creation: This is triggered when a customer service representative (service representative) resolves a case. It determines whether a new knowledge article is needed by comparing the content of the case with the existing knowledge articles in Dynamics 365 knowledge base. If an article is needed, the Customer Knowledge Management Agent creates the article using the case content.

Historical knowledge creation: When enabled, the agent looks at all the cases that meet the specified conditions and then determines if new articles are needed by comparing the content of the cases with the existing Dynamics 365 knowledge base. If a new article is needed, it creates a new article by using the content of one or more historical cases that meet the configured conditions.

Auto publish articles: Organizations can control whether the AI agent can automatically publish articles that comply with the Compliance Status you set. You can also select the target audience that can view the published articles.

Copilot is an AI-powered tool that revolutionizes the agent experience in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. It provides real-time assistance to help agents resolve issues faster, handle cases more efficiently, and automate time-consuming tasks so you can focus on delivering high-quality service to your customers.

You can use Copilot to ask free-form questions just as you'd ask your colleague or supervisor who might know the answers. Copilot uses the Dynamics 365 knowledge base along with other resources to identify and provide answers.

With Copilot, you can take the following actions:

Ask a direct question: Copilot shows the most relevant answer from the knowledge sources your organization made available.

Ask follow-up, turn by turn questions: If Copilot's response isn't immediately useful, you can ask follow-up questions and guide Copilot in a natural, conversational way.

Ask Copilot to attempt a better response: Copilot can also rephrase responses based on more guidance such as, "Can you summarize your response?" or "Can you attempt a response providing details for each of the steps you mentioned?"

Once you have Copilot’s responses, if you're satisfied with the response Copilot provides, you can use the whole thing or a part of it to answer the customer's question:

Copy part of Copilot's reply into your chat or read from it during a voice conversation. Select the copy icon to copy the entire response to the clipboard.

When you're in an active digital messaging conversation, select Send to customer to open an editing window where you can revise the response and send it to the customer. You can also change customer keywords to prompt Copilot to generate a more accurate response.

Select Check sources to see the knowledge base or website links from which Copilot drew the response. You can use this supplemental information as a resource or share it with the customer.

Write an email with Copilot

In addition to using Copilot to answer your questions, it also helps agents quickly create emails. To make the process of creating an email even simpler, Copilot provides predefined prompts such as Suggest a call, Empathize with feedback, or Provide product/service details. Selecting one of the predefined options dictates the tone of the content generated by Copilot. Additionally, if none of the predefined options are what you are looking for, you can create your own custom prompt.

Use Copilot to generate knowledge drafts

Many times, the information used to resolve a customer’s issue might be useful to others. Historically, you would have to create a supporting knowledge article manually. With Copilot, you can generate a knowledge draft while you or after you have resolved the case.

Case Management Agent

As agents become a bigger part of our everyday lives, they provide opportunities to assist human representatives as they work on cases. Some ways they can assist is by automatically creating new cases, updating existing ones, and automating customer follow-up. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the Case Management Agent can automatically create cases from chat conversations and incoming emails.

Chat

When a conversation is routed to or escalated to an agent, the Case Management Agent evaluates the context of the record. If there is enough context, the Case Management Agent will:

Map the context from the conversation to the appropriate fields.

Create a new case that opens in a new tab in the Active Conversation form.

Populate the values of the fields in the case.

Automatically save the case.

 Important

The Case Management Agent will only create the case if there's enough context in the conversation to populate the mandatory fields. If there isn't enough context, the agent doesn't create a case when you accept the conversation.

Email

In addition to creating cases from incoming conversations, The Case Management Agent can also create cases from incoming emails. When your organization is configured to create cases from incoming emails, the Case Management Agent will predict and populate the configured default fields with the context from the email.

Update a case

Another way the Case Management Agent can assist is by updating cases. For example, as you continue to chat with a customer, new information will likely present itself. With the update a case feature, when you tell it to update the case, it populates the fields with context from the ongoing conversation. Updated fields are highlighted, and a banner indicates that they were modified using AI.  

How does autonomous case follow-up work

Another option available as part of the Case Management Agent is the ability to have the agent autonomously follow-up on cases. Your organization can specify the criteria they want to use to trigger a follow-up. For example, you might automatically follow up if a case has not been closed within a specified period.

The agent checks to see if a case meets the rules set to qualify for the follow-up process. It also determines if the customer responded to your email within the configured duration for the first response time. If the status reason matches the trigger, the AI agent displays the Suggested actions card on the case form with the next steps you can take.

Suggested actions available include:

Send follow-up: This is used when the customer didn't respond to your last email within the configured duration. You are able to review and change the email suggested by the agent.

Send next follow-up: This is used when the customer didn't respond to the initial follow-up email within the configured duration.

Reply to customer: The customer responds to the email within the follow-up duration with a response that the agent can't process or that contains a negative response.

Resolve case: The customer didn't respond to any follow-up emails you sent. Select Resolve case to view the Case Resolution dialog. You can then close any open activities and resolve the case.

Intent agent

Another important factor to offering good customer service to your customers is understanding their intent. The better you understand their intent, the more appropriate service you can provide. The Customer Intent Agent uses generative AI to autonomously discover intents in your contact center instance. It analyzes past interactions between customer service representatives and customers to create an intent library that enhances dynamic conversations. Customer Intent benefits both assisted and self-service scenarios by enabling agents and representatives to quickly understand customer needs, guide conversations with follow-up questions, and provide tailored solutions in real time. The Customer Intent Agent can be used in the following scenarios:

Self-service: You can add the intent to a custom Copilot agent that connects with the intent library and dynamically chats with the customer to:

Determine customer intent based on discovered intents, such as refund, from the intent library.

Ask follow-up questions based on other attributes, such as error code, product name, and purchase date, discovered from historical conversations.

Understand responses from customers to determine what follow-up questions are answered by the customer.

Generate a query to knowledge base to search for solutions based on gathered information.

Assisted service: Significantly reduce issue handling time by continuously detecting updates to intent based on ongoing conversations and provide:

Information that's discovered by Copilot in self-service to quickly get the representative up to speed on the intent and collected information.

A curated list of questions and suggested solutions as the next response that the representative can send to the customer.

The detected intent separately suggested follow-up questions and responses, and suggested solutions in a holistic view.

As customers increasingly use social media, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, and other communication channels, service focused organizations need to provide an efficient and consistent support experience regardless of communication channel. While providing customers with flexible support options makes it easier for them to initiate support requests, it can introduce new challenges for the support organization. The biggest challenge is to be able to provide customers with that seamless and equally satisfying experience across any channel they're using to engage support.

For example, an organization provides support options through live chats, virtual agents, and phone support. It's critical the same information available through one channel is available through the others. Agents assisting over chat should have access to the same knowledge repositories as agents engaging over the phone. At the same time, as customers transition across different channels or departments, agents should know everything that happened with the customer to that point. This customer information enables a better customer experience since they don't have to re-explain or repeat any previous tried resolution steps.

With Dynamics 365 Contact Center, your agents can interact with customers through different channels to enhance the support experience that their customers receive. As your agents engage with customers, they can use contextual insights into not only the conversation, but also the customer that they're engaging with.

The Omnichannel solution provides you with the tools to configure multiple channels that agents can use to communicate with customers.

Chat: Connect with customers in real-time.

SMS: Connect to customers by using text messages.

Table Channels: Create sessions based on Dynamics 365 tables.

Social Media: Connect with customers through popular social channels such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, LINE, and More.

Voice: Connect with customer through traditional voice conversations from within Dynamics 365.

When used with Dynamics 365, Contact Center extends the core customer service functionality available in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. It provides a modern, customizable, high-productivity application that allows agents to engage with customers across different channels.

In the image, a customer from Coffee Lab is reaching out to Contoso’s contact center to ask a question related to one of their devices that isn't working.

It provides the following capabilities that help agents better service their customers:

Real-time notifications: As conversations come in, available and qualified agents receive real-time notification messages about incoming communication from customers. The notifications include the ability to accept the conversation, which opens a new session automatically.

Session management: Session tabs allow agents to work with multiple customers simultaneously. Having the ability to switch between sessions helps agents increase their efficiency. They can work with customers without losing conversation context or customer details.

Customer interaction: Through the included conversation panel, agents can easily interact with customers across different channels. As agents work with customers, the sentiment of the conversation is monitored in real time based on what the customer is typing. In addition, agents can use the knowledge base, collaborate with colleagues, and more.

AI conversation summary: As an agent is working on a conversation with the customer, the AI summary can provide the agent with:

Issue description: Summarizes the key customer problems to solve in a conversation.

Resolution tried: Summarizes any troubleshooting steps or possible solutions that agents tried.

Customer context: Agents can work with a single contextual view of the customer who based on the conversation called the Customer Summery. The Customer Summary screen provides details including:

Customer: Provides quick details related to the customer engaged with.

Case: Links the conversation to a new or existing case record for the customer.

Recent cases: Provides easy access to recent cases submitted by the customer.

Timeline: Let’s agents quickly access activities associated with the case and customer attached to conversation.

Conversation summary: Provides the agent with other contextual details related to the conversation. This can include details such as answers to prechat survey questions, browser details, what they did before initiating the chat, and context details that can be easily passed to the session.

Multiple applications: Application tabs provide agents access to relevant supporting applications in the context of the session you're working in. These applications remain in place as the agent navigates to other sessions. They're still available when the agent navigates back.

Quick access to familiar Dynamics 365 tools: Because it's built on Dataverse, agents can use existing functionality they're familiar with such as record searching, quick record creation, and agent presence information.

Proactive chat: Lets you engage customers automatically by inviting them to chat conversations based on rules you configure for factors such as end-user data, time spent on web page, and more.

Copilot Studio Integration: Customers can be routed to custom agents created with Copilot Studio to assist with triaging or to handle specific types of customer inquiries. Agents can automatically hand off conversations to agents as needed. When the conversation is routed, all previous communication with the agent is included.

Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates the conversation in real-time to monitor the customer's tone, and then updates the customer sentiment based on the conversation.

Additionally, agents can be used in the user interface to provide context-based recommendations to assist agents in resolving issues faster.

Skills-based Routing: Skill-based routing enables conversations to be routed to agents based on their skills and proficiencies. This improves the efficiency of automatic work distribution by looking for an agent with the right skills who can handle a conversation and resolve a customer issue most effectively.

Agent scripts: You can configure scripts that provide step-by-step guidance to agents. These steps can be configured and automated based on session types (such as chat or phone calls) to ensure adherence to the appropriate processes.

Voice: Agents working in Contact Center can make and receive public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls through a native calling experience in Dynamics 365. In addition to calling capabilities, it also includes real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered features such as live call transcription, sentiment analysis, and AI-based suggestions that help to boost agent productivity.

Another advantage of Contact Center is the simplicity in with many items can be deployed. For example, with a single click you can set up Contact Center with includes a chat channel that you can use.

Clickthrough demo: Contact Center

In this clickthrough demonstration, you're guided through an example of how a customer service agent might use Contact Center to provide support for multiple customers at one time, across multiple channels.

Use Contact Center

Contact Center provides agents with the tools to deliver exceptional service experiences on any channel. Tools like real-time sentiment analysis help agents better understand the mood of the customer at that moment so they can act accordingly to provide the best support possible.

Throughout their day, agents need to spend a significant amount of time performing repetitive tasks and entering data into different systems. This requirement often leads to spending more time on administrative work, and less time working with customers. It also lends itself to errors. Agents can easily enter information in the wrong spot, or they can enter incorrect information. Organizations are always looking for ways to assist their agents in these activities and reduce the possibility of errors.

The Dynamics 365 Productivity tools app includes capabilities to help users perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner and deliver value to customers. Organizations can use the Productivity tools app to help with repetitive and monotonous tasks, such as greeting customers and filling out forms. It also helps with displaying AI-based suggestions for knowledge articles and similar cases to agents, and consequently helps users perform day-to-day operations in a fast, efficient, and process-compliant manner.

There are four primary components that are available with the Productivity Tools app:

Macros: Macros allow agents to perform repetitive tasks with a single click. These tasks include creating and resolving cases, prepopulating columns, sending emails, and taking notes. Running a macro performs a series of actions, saving time and allowing agents to handle more customer issues.

Agent scripts: Agent scripts provide your agents with guidance about what to do when they get a customer issue. Organizations can create multiple scripts based on the different support scenarios they provide. Scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared, while also safeguarding the organization regarding legal-compliance issues. They also help to streamline the onboarding process, as they provide newer agents with complete guidance on how to resolve issues.

Smart assist: Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to agents, helping them take actions while interacting with customers. You can use the AI-based suggestions for knowledge articles and similar cases by enabling the feature. You can also build a custom agent to interpret the conversation context and provide suggestions to agents. These recommendation cards are displayed on the agent user interface based on the context of the current conversation.

Microsoft Teams: Microsoft Teams is a tool that can help agents more easily collaborate with colleagues by using the capabilities of Teams within Dynamics 365. Agents can view their chats, and with admin setup, can view chats that are relevant to certain records, also known as connected chats. Connecting all their chats in one place helps agents work without switching context or leaving the application. Admins can also configure an optional introduction note that agents can use to provide further context when collaborating on Teams.

In the image, you can see the Smart Assist feature being displayed in the Productivity panel on the right side of the screen.

A typical contact center such as Contoso Coffee’s contact center can handle thousands of calls per day. While details of individual support cases are different, there are often similarities between cases. For example, one customer might have a problem with their coffee machine powering on, while another might report an issue with their machine not staying on. Even though they're different issues, they are both power related problems. Grouping cases based on similarities can provide your organization with a more accurate representation of emerging trends, resolution times, customer satisfaction and more. For example, if 25% of calls last week were power related issues, you might want to dive deeper into the calls.

You can further examine items such as:

How long on average are agents spending on these calls?

How does this compare to last week or past performance over a specific period?

Does this represent an increase in volume, or is it in line with a normal week?

What else do we know about these cases?

By diving deeper, Contoso notices that 90% of the cases were related to machines not powering on. You can use this data to improve your organizational efficiency. After some research, it’s identified that it could be one of two issues:

Faulty Power Switch: A faulty power switch on the machine results in a short surge of power followed by the machine’s screen going black. Typically, in this case, a replacement machine needs to be sent out.

Faulty Power Cable: A faulty cable means that nothing happens at all when the customer attempts to power up the machine. This issue is easily resolved by sending the customer a new cable.

To help solve this issue, Contoso Coffee creates a customer service agent that includes trouble shooting steps for working through power related issues. If the product has a faulty power cable, the agent can assist the customer in sending out a replacement cable. If the product has a faulty power switch, the agent can transfer the customer to a live representative for more troubleshooting before sending out a replacement product. A simple measure such as this could reduce Contoso Coffee’s individual agent call volumes by 20% or more.

Insights dashboards for Customer Service and Dynamics 365 Contact center help you to better understand different factors that can help improve customer service for your organization. Charts, Key performance indicators (KPIs), and visual breakdowns of your organization's support cases are coupled with AI-generated insights on cases, agents, and topics that contribute to overall trends.

The insights dashboards cover Customer Service, Contact Center, and Knowledge Management. With the Customer Service dashboards, you can view a performance summary breakdown and examine detailed reports on your agents and topics. Similarly, the Contact Center dashboards provide a view into the support operation across channels. For knowledge managers, Knowledge Search analytics provide insight into search terms being used by agents to uncover content needed to resolve customer issues.

Artificial intelligence automatically groups your cases into topics using natural language understanding such as grouping defective product cases into a single topic. Topics allow you to discover and adapt to current and emerging trends, identify problem areas, and improve brand sentiment. By pinpointing and fixing issues before they impact customers, you can deliver better customer service experiences.

The AI driven technology facilitates informed decision-making related to improving resolution rates, reducing wait times, and decreasing customer service costs. You can use case resolution insights, backlog trends, and historical comparisons to evaluate agent performance and business impact, and address inefficiencies in your system.

The term field service is used to refer to any service that is performed in the field rather than at a company facility. It generally involves dispatching workers or contractors to specific locations. These locations can include customer sites, where the workers install, repair, or maintain equipment or systems. For example, an organization might dispatch a technician to come to your home or office to repair a damaged windshield, as opposed to you bringing your automobile to them for service.

Another way to think of field service is mobile workforce management. Depending on the organization and industry, the procedure might be different, but the general concept of what they're trying to do is the same. A mobile workforce needs to be scheduled and dispatched to provide services to customers. Regardless of the industry, organizations often use field service applications because they include tools designed for this process.

For example:

Manufacturing: A medical device manufacturer sells machines to hospitals and clinics and uses a field service application to manage maintenance services over the lifetime of the machines.

Utilities: A fiber optic cable company uses a field service application. This application helps respond to outages by dispatching technicians to problem areas.

Describe the work order lifecycle
15 minutes

In Dynamics 365 Field Service, a work order refers to a task or a job needing to be scheduled or assigned to someone. Work orders generally include information such as:

who is the work order for
the type of work needs to be performed
timeframes
products and services to be delivered
tasks that need to be done

For example, Contoso Coffee might create a work order for a customer whose espresso machine is not circulating water needs to be repaired.

That’s only one example of a scenario where a work order is created. Work orders can be created for any number of scenarios including:

An internal request for a new piece of equipment to be installed.

A follow-up on an inspection or audit.

Dispatch of a technician based on an alert generated by an IoT device.

A case that cannot be resolved remotely and requires a technician to be dispatched.

How and when organizations create work orders depends on multiple factors such as their service model, procedures, and technology being used. Dynamics 365 Field Service supports the creation of work orders in many ways. Some ways that an organization can create a work order include:

As part of a defined service selling process:

Manually created after an order was placed

Automatically created from a sales opportunity created in Dynamics 365

As an escalation for a case that could not be resolved remotely

Automatically converted to work order based on case records created in Dynamics 365

Manually based on a customer request or scheduling service from a portal

Automatically based on a service agreement or schedule

Automatically from an event raised by an IoT Device

Each work order has a status that defines the current state of the work order. The status lets individuals know where the work order is at in its lifecycle process.

The available work order statuses are:

Open – Unscheduled: Indicates that the work order was created but isn't yet scheduled in the system.

Open – Scheduled: Indicates that the work order was scheduled and a resource was assigned responsibility for completing the work.

Open – In Progress: Indicates that a field agent is actively working on the item.

Open – Completed: Indicates that the work was completed, and the work order might be waiting for final approval to ensure that everything was done correctly.

Closed – Posted: Indicates that the work order is closed, and billing can take place.

Closed – Canceled: Indicates that the work on the item wasn't completed and was canceled.

As the work order proceeds through its lifecycle, the status is reflected on the word order record in Dynamics 365. While each organization is a little different, the stages that a work order goes through during its lifecycle are like the graphic.

Work order creation: A work order is created, usually from a case or opportunity

Schedule: The work order is then scheduled.

Dispatch: The work order is dispatched.

Service: The work order is performed, and details are updated.

Review/Approval: A supervisor reviewed and approved the work order.

Invoice and inventory adjustment: Inventory adjustments are made, and an invoice is generated for the corresponding account.

Additionally, organizations can track costs and expenses associated with work orders. Work order information can be used for cost tracking and helps organizations identify how much each work order is costing them.

Lab simulation: Create a work order in Dynamics 365 Field Service

In this lab simulation, you'll be guided through two work order creation scenarios. First, you'll be guided through the steps of creating a work order from a case record, and then the steps of creating a work order manually.

Create a work order in Dynamics 365 Field Service

As you saw, Dynamics 365 Field Service provides multiple options for creating work orders based on the needs of your organization. Once created, important information such as the products needed, and the services to be provided, can be automatically populated based on what the work order is for. Other important information such as priority, scheduling windows, and customer preferences can also be defined to help provide guidance as the work order is scheduled.

Incident Types

Incident types in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service act as templates that allow users to quickly create work orders for these common types of jobs. You can also use incident types to define specific work order issues and recommended resolutions.

Incident types prepopulate the detail of the work order, which you can manually edit as needed.

Organizations benefit from using incident types because they codify issues, procedures, and resolutions, and help standardize processes across geographies and business lines. Incident types ensure that all field technicians perform the same actions to resolve work orders. Moreover, if better procedures are discovered, the incident type is updated and implemented across the entire organization.

Using incident types helps you save time while creating work orders. Without using incident types, the customer service reps or dispatchers who are creating work orders would have to manually add details.

Incident types are helpful for reporting because they allow you to see trends for specific issues. By using an incident type, you can report on the number of power failures for a specific asset category. This approach is different from reporting on work order types to understand the number of repair work orders.

Other important incident type features include the ability to:

Define multiple issues or procedures that need to be completed by adding the incident types to a work order.

Relate each incident type to a customer asset to build service history.

Relate incident types to requirement group templates to auto populate multiple requirements for a work order and schedule it to multiple resources.

Use incident types in agreements to auto populate the work orders that are created for preventative maintenance.

Service Tasks

As onsite workers are working on work orders, they often have specific tasks they need to accomplish. For example, while fixing a coffee machine they may need to complete the following tasks:

Complete the pre-Inspection assessment.

Cut power to device.

Inspect the power supply.

Post the assessment inspection.

Gather customer signature.

Service tasks can be added to work orders to act as a "to do list" for the onsite workers. Each task can be marked as complete as they complete it. Service tasks can be added to incident types as well. This ensures that when an incident type is selected for a specific work order, the service tasks will automatically be populated.

Technicians, and administrative individuals such as service managers and dispatchers, need to be able to answer questions and perform tasks quickly. With Copilot in Field Service, these individuals can take full advantage of copilot capabilities in the Field Service web application. Onsite workers can access copilot functionality directly from the Field Service Mobile app. Copilot can summarize information related to work orders and service accounts, help catch up on recent changes to records, prepare for onsite visits, and answer questions about related information. Like all copilots, it has a chat interface that dispatchers and technicians can use to interact with Copilot in natural language.

In addition to the copilot chat interface, Copilot in Field Service can complete the following tasks:

Provide a work order summary: An AI-generated work order and booking recap provide a summary of a record and its related data. The recap summarizes the record's history, future actions, arrival times, work criticality, required parts, and other contextual information. This summary makes it easy for service managers, dispatchers, and frontline workers to quickly understand the context and the next steps.

Perform work order updates: While working in the mobile app, onsite workers can use Copilot to update important fields on a work order such as booking statuses, product quantities, service durations, and more.

Describe inspections in Dynamics 365 Field Service
8 minutes

As mentioned earlier, service tasks can be added to a work order to act as a to-do list to provide guidance to the agent. For example, if a technician is performing an annual machine inspection and cleaning, they might have a task on the work order called "perform machine inspection" that has a duration of 30 minutes. For them to be able to complete the machine inspection, there may be questions that need to be answered, or additional information needed.

For example, as part of the machine inspection, they may need to:

Verify where the machine is located.

Make sure there's no damage to the machine's power cord, or plugin.

Verify all seals are still tight.

Check the date any seals might expire.

Verify the water tank is clean and doesn't have any corrosion.

Once they completed all the items defined, they can mark the machine inspection task as complete. In Dynamics 365 Field Service, inspections are digital forms that a technician can use to answer questions quickly and easily as part of a work order.

Compared to work order incident types and service tasks, inspections have other benefits:

Easier to create: Administrators can quickly create an inspection with a drag-and-drop interface without needing to create new entities and fields.

Easier to fill out: Technicians can quickly enter responses for each inspection question. They can save all responses at once, rather than having to open and close multiple work order service task records.

More flexible and robust: Field Service inspections have many question formats and validation options, such as multi-option selection, mandatory fields, images, attachments, and more.

Questions can include safety protocols, pass-and-fail tests for a customer asset, or an interview with a customer. They can also include other audits and assessments performed before, during, or after a work order, such as the safety inspection that we referenced earlier.

Inspections in Field Service also provide:

Offline support: Technicians can view and fill out inspections on their mobile phones or tablets without internet access. Answers are synchronized when connectivity is restored (cellular or Wi-Fi).

Customer assets: Inspections can be associated with assets, allowing users to see a history of all inspections for a particular piece of equipment.

Version management: Administrators can continuously update and publish inspections to accommodate changing processes and evolving business needs.

While you're performing work, you can select the Work Order Service Task that has the related inspection. As you complete the inspection, you can upload files, take pictures, or upload pictures from the phone's camera roll. Comments can also be added while uploading a file or images.

Clickthrough demo: Work with Inspections

In this clickthrough demonstration, you're guided through the end-to-end process of creating an inspection.

Work with inspections

As you saw, Inspections help ensure technicians aren't missing any steps while working at customer locations. Inspections provide the next level of guidance and assurance to technicians by defining the steps that need to be taken. They simplify data entry and provide the ability to capture and add images. This leads to better service and greater customer satisfaction.

It's important that agents working in the field have all the necessary information, tools, and resources accessible to them to ensure they can provide the required level of service to customers. The agent needs details on where to go and guidance as to what to do when they arrive. The field agent needs to have the information that makes it easy to obtain necessary assistance when required. For example, a technician who's working on a specific model of coffee machine should be able to easily identify and engage with subject matter experts who can assist them remotely. Once the job is completed and a resolution is found, technicians should be able to provide the necessary details about the resolution. The field agent needs to add notes on the resolution, or capture a customer signature, while in the field. Regardless of the scenario, a field agent should have all the necessary tools required to complete their job right at their fingertips.

When we say agents should have the information and tools they need, we're referring to more than just providing them with an overview of what needs to be done. They need to be equipped to resolve the issue the first time regardless of where they're executing the work.

In addition to providing the technician with work order details, the technician requires:

Customer location information.

The ability to take and attach images or videos.

Support for bar code scanning.

The ability to provide details on specific parts and services they're going to provide.

The ability to capture a customer signature.

The ability to easily engage with subject matter experts while working in the field.

Access to data while working either on or offline.

The Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app

The Dynamics 365 Field Service Mobile application is built on the Power Platform and provides field agents with the tools they need to service customers in the field. While the agents are working in the field, they can easily access important information such as work orders assigned to them, lists of customer assets, accounts, and contacts. The mobile application also provides agents with a daily schedule view. This schedule view makes it convenient for them to view and manage their schedule. To make it easy to group bookings and their attached work orders together, agents only need to open one item. The agents can then view and enter data for the booking and the work order at the same time.

In addition to providing details about specific jobs, agents can view customer location information. Agents can trigger turn-by-turn driving directions from a GPS app on their phone. Supported apps include Bing Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, or Google Maps.

Since agents don't always have internet connectivity, the Dynamics 365 Field Service Mobile application is accessible by agents while they're working offline or online. As an organization, you can determine which users have access to offline mode and define the data that is available to them while working offline.

Summarize work orders with Copilot in new mobile experience

Onsite workers can take advantage of Copilot functionality in the mobile app.

Work order summaries: Technicians are provided with a summary of their work orders while working in the Field Service mobile application. The summary provides them with meaningful context of the work they are about to perform. It can include notes, diagnostic information, key events in the work order lifecycle, and recommendations.

Update work orders with Copilot: Technicians can update various details regarding the booking and work order using a speech-first Copilot experience. While the technician narrates, Copilot makes suggestions to update the following values:

Mark service tasks as completed.

Mark products and services as used and update their quantity.

Update the status of the booking based on the work performed.

Update other fields on the booking, such as start time and end time.

The image shows an example of the work order summarization capabilities.

The Field Service mobile app is supported on both IOS and Android platforms. More specific details related to supporting operating systems can be found here.

Schedulers and dispatchers spend much of their day working viewing and responding to emails. This means that they often receive work order requests and scheduling requests directly from customer emails.

The Dynamics 365 Field Service app for Outlook integrates with your schedulers email and allows them to create and schedule customer work orders without ever needing to leave Microsoft Outlook. While viewing a customer email, you can open the Field Service component. Once open, you can view a list of existing work orders, or you can use Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service to create a work order based on email content.

Copilot scans the email's contents and gives suggestions on how to create the work order. As a scheduler, you can take those suggestions or modify them as needed.

In addition to helping to create work orders, the Field Service add-in also helps schedule work orders directly from Outlook. It examines the item that you're looking to schedule and provides scheduling suggestions based on technicians' availability and skills, proximity to the customer's location, promised time windows, and the business unit.

Organizations that manage mobile workforces or deliver services to customers can encounter a wide range of scheduling scenarios and challenges. Not only do you need to identify who is available to work on an item, but you need to ensure the person being scheduled is qualified to perform the tasks needed. As a dispatcher, it's imperative that you're equipped with all the information that can dictate, influence, or impact scheduling decisions. This helps avoid bad experiences, unhappy customers, and ultimately lost revenue.

It's important that your scheduling solution provides you with the tools necessary to support your specific scheduling needs. Regardless of your businesses approach and scheduling model being used, your scheduling solution should be able to identify and provide answers to the following questions:

Is the item ready to be scheduled: Just because a work order was created doesn't always mean that it's ready to be scheduled. Many times, you need to wait for things like parts to arrive before you schedule the item.

What types of resources to I need to schedule: Does the item require people, or a specific piece of equipment? Does it require multiple resources?

Who is qualified to work on this item: What skills, certifications, roles, trades, etc. are needed to work on the item?

When does it need to be done: Are there specific service windows or time periods that we need to work with?

Customer constraints: Is there anything at a customer level that could influence my decision as to which resource to schedule? For example, are there resources the customer would prefer or prefer not to work with?

Geography: Where is the work taking place, what qualified resources do I have in that area that meet those requirements?

Cancelations: How do we deal with cancelations or requests to reschedule?

The list doesn't represent a complete list of things that need to be considered. It does, however, give you an idea of what is important when providing a scheduling solution.

Dynamics 365 Field Service provides multiple ways to assist dispatchers in managing the daily schedules of their workforce. Options range from manually managing and scheduling items to fully automated scheduling solutions where dispatchers mainly focus on handing schedule anomalies or special situations.

The options provided by Dynamics 365 include:

Manual scheduling: The schedule board helps in providing dispatchers with the information they need. From the schedule board, they can easily see all the currently unscheduled items and the availability of all resources (people, facilities, equipment) and schedule those items directly from the board.

Schedule assistant: The schedule assistant can be directly from a work order or from the schedule board. It offers suggestions of potential resources and time slots to schedule an item for. These suggestions are based on requirements captured on the record such as skills needed, time windows and more.

Optimized or automated scheduling: Resource scheduling optimization allows organizations to automatically schedule and reschedule items based on predefined goals. This optimization can include maximizing technician working time, minimizing travel, and scheduling high priority items first.

The Dynamics 365 Field Service schedule board

Dispatchers typically need a lot of information at their disposal. Depending on their organization's size, a dispatcher can be scheduling anywhere from 20 to hundreds of potential resources daily. To ensure everyone is where they need to be, and that customers are getting the service required, dispatchers need to understand things like:

What is currently scheduled?

What needs to be scheduled?

Who is available?

What does traffic look like?

The schedule board assists dispatchers like Marco to better understand this information. They can see in real-time what is scheduled including the resources assigned, times, and status. In addition, they can see what needs to be scheduled as well as the availability of resources such as people, facilities, and equipment.

See a quick overview of the panels and components that are most often used.

Schedule Calendar: Displays a list of resources and currently scheduled items. The schedule calendar can be used to schedule new items and interact with existing scheduled items.

Filter Pane: Provides access to interactive filters that can be used to help in scheduling.

Map Pane: Provides a map that can be used to help in scheduling.

Details: Provides more details of the item that's currently selected.

Resource Requirements: Provides a list of active requirements that need to be scheduled.

Many things can occur throughout the day that impact scheduling. As these changes or items occur, a dispatcher needs to be able to make schedule changes as quickly as possible. Examples of things that can impact scheduling might include:

An emergency work order that was created and needs someone to be scheduled now.

A customer canceling or needing to reschedule.

A resource calling in sick and needing to find a replacement.

An accident occurred on a specific highway.

There are multiple ways that items can be scheduled on the schedule board.

Those ways are:

Manually dragging and moving items around on the schedule board.

Using find availability to initiate the schedule assistant.

Directly from the map view.

Manually blocking off time on the calendar.

While the manual scheduling options on the schedule board are handy, most times it's easiest to schedule directly from a work order itself using the schedule assistant. When the schedule assistant loads, it shows potential resources that could be scheduled for the item based on what is required. All available resources and their open timeslots are displayed. The filter criteria used to display the results can be modified to expand or reduce the number of results returned.

In the image, the schedule assistant identifies multiple resources who belong to the Midwest territory and have availability to work on a specific item.

The schedule board offers multiple ways that dispatchers can reschedule items or substitute different resources. Depending on what the specific need it, dispatchers can take the following actions:

Rebook: Rebooking moves a booking to a different time or day and assigns it to a different resource. This option is typically used when a customer needs to completely reschedule.

Substitute Resource: Keeps the booking at its original time and replaces the original resource associated with the booking with a different resource. For example, a technician is no longer available to work on an item, and it needs to be assigned to a different person.

Move items to a different day: Moves multiple items from the current day to the same time on a different day. This move might occur if the booking was made in advance and schedule changes no longer allow you to execute it on those days.

Schedule Operations Agent

Schedulers and dispatchers face many different challenges when trying to keep all of their technicians optimally busy. Throughout a given day, they can spend a considerable time adjusting technician schedules. Some of the things that can lead to needing adjustments include:

Cancellations: The dispatcher needs to choose work to fill the open slots.

Exceeding time of current booking: This can lead to cascading delays for subsequent bookings.

Out-of-date or low priority bookings: The dispatcher needs to update the technician's schedule to front-load higher-priority work that emerged recently.

In Dynamics 365 Field Service, users can take advantage of the AI-driven Scheduling Operations Agent. The agent uses an optimization algorithm that considers existing bookings and requirements when scheduling work. Dispatchers can prompt Copilot to suggest a schedule for a specific onsite worker. It suggests settings that you can adjust before it starts generating an optimized schedule. Adjust the settings as needed to ensure that the agent suggests a schedule that meets your needs. The Scheduling Operations Agent can consider several factors which include:

Scheduling goal: The scheduling goal informs the agent what the expected outcome of the optimization is.

Time range: Allows you to select the range of time over which the agent should optimize the schedule.

Requirements: The agent can consider unfulfilled requirements when it optimizes the schedule, select a resource requirement view. You can select any view that you have access to, including shared views, system views, and personal views.

Match required skills: It will look for bookings and requirements that require the skills that the resource has.

Match territories: It will look for bookings and requirements that have the same territory as the resource.

Schedule within time promised window: The agent considers time constraints that are placed on requirements and bookings.

By using the Scheduling Operations Agent, schedulers and dispatchers will be much more efficient when needing to make schedule adjustments for a resource.

Customers are going to have equipment that, as an organization, you might be responsible for inspecting, maintaining, and repairing. A manufacturing company may use a piece of assembly line equipment to create products and goods for sale. In the case of Contoso Coffee, a smart device such as an IoT-enabled coffee machine may be used for preventative maintenance.

Dynamics 365 Field Service empowers organizations to be able to maintain a catalog of the different assets for all the customers that they service. By maintaining this catalog, you can easily see what maintenance and repairs were done on the equipment along with being able to quickly open new work orders related to them.

By using the asset management capabilities of Dynamics 365 Field Service, you can:

Easily see all the assets associated with a specific customer

Quickly identify where the asset is located

Open work orders and track against a customer asset

Identify any sub assets that are associated with a primary asset

Remotely monitor and interact with IoT enabled Assets (when combined with Connected Field Service)

Throughout this remainder of this module, we dive deeper into the asset management capabilities provided in Dynamics 365 Field Service.

Asset management and customer assets

In Dynamics 365 Field Service, the customer asset record is used to represent specific pieces of equipment that a customer owns and at their locations. An asset can be anything such as a large piece of manufacturing equipment, technology, an appliance, or an air conditioner.

By using customer assets, field service organizations can:

Record and maintain specific information about the item.

Create a historical log of all the work orders that are related to the item.

Associate the asset with an IoT enabled device that can be interacted with remotely.

Customer assets can be created and defined manually or can be automatically created. Many times, a customer asset starts as a product that is stored in a warehouse. After the product was delivered to the customer, it can be automatically converted into an asset. For example, after an installer completes a work order, a commercial espresso machine can be installed for a customer. The espresso machine can then be automatically converted into a customer asset, allowing for future work orders to be associated with it.

When defining an asset in the application, you can include important information. This may include the customer the asset belongs to, its location, associated product, and IoT properties for remote interaction.

Additionally, if the asset itself has any sub assets associated with it, those assets can be noted and stored on the asset as well. For example, a large piece of manufacturing equipment might have multiple assemblies and other items on it that can be serviced individually. By noting all this information on the asset, you have a more complete picture of what is occurring.

As work orders are opened against the customer asset, you can easily access them from the asset. A work order might be created when a customer contacts you about a repair that needs to happen, or it could be generated automatically as a preventative maintenance work order.

Describe Connected Field Service for Dynamics 365
9 minutes

Smart devices or Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices have become a much larger part of our daily lives. They let you control almost everything from light switches, to televisions, to automobiles with just a click of a button or with our voice. As more smart devices come online, organizations are being presented with new opportunities for providing support to customers. For example, sensors on manufacturing equipment might monitor the temperature of the machine. If the temperature starts to rise above a specific point, an alert could be triggered to notify someone of the situation.

Connected Field Service enables organizations to transform the way they provide service, from a costly break-fix model to a proactive and predictive service model through the combination of IoT diagnostics, scheduling, asset maintenance, and inventory on the same platform. With Dynamics 365 Connected Field Service solution organizations can remotely monitor, manage, and maintain IoT devices directly from Dynamics 365 Field Service.

The key benefits of Connected Field Service are:

Reduce downtime by connecting to IoT devices to diagnose problems before customers are aware of an issue.

Address issues faster by remotely monitoring devices and keeping customers in the loop.

Device data and service maintenance data help to make intelligent decisions around dispatching technicians with the right expertise, availability, and proximity to the job.

The Connected Field Service solution includes multiple components that help to assist in monitoring and managing IoT devices.

The most common components are:

Customer Asset: As mentioned previously, it's a physical piece of equipment that is sitting at a customer location that work orders can be opened against.

Device Category: Used to group IoT Devices based on similarities, such as the type of device. This assists in simplifying the administration and management of devices.

IoT Device: Represents an IoT connected device that is being managed by an IoT management solution. As mentioned previously, these devices are typically connected to a Customer Asset record.

IoT Alert: Represents an event that was sent to Connected Field Service because of a notable event that was logged against an IoT Device.

IoT Device Command: Used to remotely interact with a connected IoT device by passing JSON commands to the device.

Command Definitions: Used to predefine commands to streamline sending them to devices. When creating a Command, a Command Definition can be selected, and any defined properties will be populated.

Property Definitions: Used to define specific properties that can be passed as part of a Command Definition.

Let’s examine how Connected Field Service works

Customer Asset created: A customer asset record such as a smart coffee machine is created in Dynamics 365 Field Service.

IoT Device record is created: The customer asset is registered as an IoT device which uses automation software such as Power Automate to register the coffee machine in an IoT management solution such as Azure IoT Central or IoT hub.

Once registered, an IoT Device record for the coffee machine is created in Dynamics 365.

IoT device reports anomaly: An alert such as a water pressure related event is logged in an IoT management solution such as Azure IoT Central or IoT hub.

Alert is sent to Connected Field Service: The item is sent to Connected Field Service and logged as an IoT Alert related to the device using an automation software such as Power Automate.

The IoT Alert is stored against the IoT Device record.

The device is interacted with remotely: Commands such as a reset command are sent to the device from Connected Field Service using automation software.

In scenarios where the device can't be interacted with, you can escalate the alert into a case and/or a work order in Field Service.
